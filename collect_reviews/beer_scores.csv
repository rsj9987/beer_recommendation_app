Asahi Super Dry,3.25,3.0,3.25,3.25,"Poured a 500 ml can into a pint glass. Best before July 2022. A one finger white head on a clear straw. The head soon diminishes to a thin layer. Some patchy lacing.

Asahi Super Dry,3.75,3.25,3.25,3.25,"Small bbq at the neighbors. He knows I "" love fancy beer "" and he had a few of these in his fridge. Cool looking large can!.

Look - Only poured enough for a look. Straw yellow with excellent clarity. Low carbonation. Good stick.

Smell - Rice Lager you ain't kidding. Adjuncty but clean. Slightest of sweetness in the nose.

Taste - Yep some rice. Slight sweetness. Avoids the corn.

Feel - Frothy body. Swallows easy. Lives up to its drying namesake as you get further into the can.

Overall - No frills but an above average basic lager. Wouldn't have any problems throwing back a few more. Happy to try.Aug 25, 2021"
Asahi Super Dry,2.25,1.5,1.75,2.0,"This looks terrible. Two 11.2 ounce brown bottles have just released their contents into a clear glass liter mug. The starchy white head, despite a deliberate pour, is ridiculous. Then there's the ""color"", one of the lightest ambers that still can be considered amber. Probably the most transparent beer you will find. There's only a little starchy character to smell. Only a little glass lacing rescues the visual, but nothing can salvage the lack of aroma. Taste, what taste? This is as tasteless a beer as one could find. There's remarkably only traces of hops and malt here. It drinks like a Coor's Light diluted with club soda. It's best feature is bringing a 5% ABV that's virtually undetectable, even with the lack of everything else. It is dry.Jul 01, 2021"
Asahi Super Dry,3.0,2.75,3.0,2.75,"Highly carbonated straw yellow body with a quickly evaporating soap bubble head. Slight herbal aroma.

Asahi Super Dry,4.0,3.5,3.75,4.0,"Clear gold color on the pour. Light skim of crackling white head. Lots of visible carbonation bubbles.

Smell is yeast like. Bread like aroma also has a faint sweet aroma. Picking up malts as well.

Taste is lightly leaning towards a Euro Lager with just a hint of grass taste. Picking up just a light sweetness.

The mouth feel is amazing. Lots of carbonation bouncing around on the tongue. The beer is actually as advertised dry. And light as well finish is extremely crisp.

Although there is not a lot of complexity in the flavor department lets examine what this beer offers. The pour is presents a very pleasant looking beer. Just looks inviting. Nothing overpowering or offensive on the nose. The mouth feel is very refreshing and that crisp finish is very nice. I see this beer pairing well with some spicy foods. Also seems great for a hot summer day. I really do have to say I really like this beer.Apr 11, 2021"
Asahi Super Dry,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,"Jeezus this beer advocate group is populated by a bunch of people who seem to think that beer is supposed to be flavored by coconut, jalapeno peppers and pineapple juice.

Asahi Super Dry,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.75,"glass pint bomber with a 9/11/21 best by date

pours a clear slightly paled yellow gold body with an excited and billowing clean white foam head that has moderately high retention, leaving a few clusters of thick sticky lacing behind as it settles to a murky foam cap after a handful of minutes and a few sips.

the aroma is very muffled and subdued, but there is a fruit-tinged yeast and herbal hop combo to be discovered. 

the taste is a fairly sweet affair with a bit of citrus sprucing up a barely-there sweet rice cake malt, faintly herbal hops, and a very interesting yeast that hangs out on the back of a grape must note - a singular, but sustained note.

the mouthfeel: high carbonation, light bodied. it's fairly grainy yet easy overall with a thinner, almost watery feel. there is a brisk dry finish that is peppered by dialed down herbal and spicy hops, but mostly notable is more of that yeast flaring up, which decides to stick around for a spell. 

overall:
you'd be a damn fool to expect anything more than an easy everyday lager, but you might catch something a little extra if you land on a solid batch or come in with the proper mood and respect or good company. dogfish did the Noble Rot a while back, and this thing somewhat reminds me of that with it's flashes of yeasty grape must - although what was turned to 11 in that Dogfish, this much more modest Asahi is comfortable at a reasonable 3. just enough, really.Apr 07, 2021"
Asahi Super Dry,3.0,2.25,2.25,2.75,"Very carbonated. The taste is a little grainy and a little hoppy. The aftertaste is a bit bitter, reminiscent of eating something that is slightly burnt.

Asahi Super Dry,4.75,3.0,3.0,3.5,"Asahi Super Dry pours into my glass crystal clear, and the color of pale, ripe hay. Thin streams of pinpoint carbonation support a rocky, bone white head with decent retention.
Taking a sniff, the first thing I notice is a faint, sweet aroma. Beyond that, the aroma is impressively neutral. This makes me wonder if Asahi uses rice as an adjunct in their grain bill. Asahi’s overall neutral aroma does come on the back of a very faint hint of bready pale malts. Faint graininess leads into a neutral center and a finish almost completely lacking in character. I don’t even pick up a whiff of hops in the finish, which is disappointing but not unpleasant in character.
Taking a sip, I notice Asahi’s mouthfeel first. It’s slick and smooth up front, with spritzy carbonation leading swiftly into a dry and lasting finish. As with the nose, the flavor profile is neutral, almost to the point of lacking any flavors at all. But only almost. With its faint grainy flavors up front, and neutral center from the use of rice, Asahi still tastes like lager. What’s more, with its smooth mouthfeel, balance, and lack of off flavors Asahi Super Dry tastes like a better version of those lawnmower beers we’ve all been subjected to in our lives.
As lagers go, it occupies that strange place where it borders on being good despite its almost complete lack of any real flavor or character. Despite lacking any of the real flavors I’ve noted in better lager, Asahi is decent tasting in its own right, balanced and refreshing. I will take one of these beers over a mainstream lager any day, especially if I’m having some spicy southeast Asian food for supper.Oct 28, 2020"
Asahi Super Dry,4.75,4.0,4.25,4.0,"When i picked this up i didnt think much of it other than, well i havent tried it. The look when it pours is a medium orange and the head is firm and fluffy which it does stay during the drinking period. The smell reminds me of a European Pils and doesnt vary much depending on temperature. The taste also remind me of a European drop rather than something from Asia as it taste robust and strong and the feel is almost a creamy texture due to the the light carbonation and creamy head. Overall a top beer that surprised me and i will be buying a box next time.Sep 15, 2020"

Asahi Super Dry,3.5,3.75,4.0,3.75,"Very well balanced beer. Enjoyed from an ice cold tallboy can.

Kloud Original Gravity,3.75,3.5,3.5,4.0,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a two finger white head with thick lacing and very active carbonation. Aroma of grainy malt and light grassy hops, slight grapefruit. Flavor is light, grainy biscuit malt, dry grassy hops; thins out in the finish, but with a nice mellow light biscuity malt flavor with light residual hops. A lightly creamy, medium body; better than expected. Listed here as a German pilsner, but style is not indicated on the bottle. This seems to be mild German pilsner meets adjunct lager. The aroma and initial flavor have a typical pilsner grainy malt flavor, although a bit watered down, then developing an adjunct-like sweet malt taste before thinning out into the light malt finish which once again had light grainy and grassy hop notes. More interesting than an adjunct lager, but thin and mediocre as a pilsner. The body, on the other hand, was more robust than expected and kind of redeemed this one. Although I'd never buy this at home, it would probably be a satisfactory lunch beer where the only alternative is adjunct lager. A step up from most mass produced asian lagers.Nov 15, 2017"

Kloud Original Gravity,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,"330ml bottle - heh, a ""Lotte Liquor""? I'm giggling like Sterling Archer at this outfit's moniker.

This beer pours a clear, bright pale golden yellow colour, with a teeming tower of puffy, loosely foamy, and bubbly bone-white head, which leaves some decent layered, broken webbed lace around the glass as it lazily subsides.

It smells of grainy and biscuity pale malt, a subtle corn-fed sweetness, gentle apple and underripe pear fruity notes, a touch of earthy lager yeast, and some moderately assertive leafy, weedy, and grassy green hoppiness. The taste is gritty and grainy pale malt, more somewhat sugary corn pone essences, a fading generic pome and citrusy fruitiness, and more plain leafy, herbal and wet grassy green hop bitters.

The carbonation is adequate for the quotidian job at hand, via its plain-ass frothiness, the body a so-so medium weight, and mostly smooth, nothing really playing the fool here in terms of interference patterns, as such. It finishes trending dry, the biscuity character of the malt continuing to charm me out of my socks.

Yeah, this is patently the best brew, bar none, that I have ever tried from this Asian country - this 'distillery turned brewery' has certainly got their shit in order, even discounting the perceived corn-ish contributions, which really don't amount to a hill of beans here. If you didn't tell me otherwise, I'd be easily convinced that I was drinking a decent middle-range brew from der Vaterland itself.Aug 05, 2016"
Kloud Original Gravity,3.0,2.25,2.75,3.5,"Overall this is not inline with a typical German pilsner - very little hops presence, very malty and very light and ""adjuncty.""

Kloud Original Gravity,3.25,2.75,2.5,2.5,"Just your standard Adjunct lager brewed in Korea. A little skunkiness, overly sweet, too much carbonation, and not much hop flavor. On par with like a miller. Nothing impressive here.May 11, 2016"
Kloud Original Gravity,3.25,3.0,3.0,4.0,"Produced 1/26/16.

Pours a clear gold with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, corn flake, sugar, and grass aromas. Taste is much the same with grain, sweetened corn flake, and grass flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is quite decent for a South Korean take on a German beer style.

Kloud Original Gravity,3.0,2.75,3.25,3.25,"Bottle at Kristalbelli, New York, NY

A: The beer is crystal clear yellow in color and has a moderate amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a thin white head that left a collar around the edge of the glass.
S: Moderate aromas of sweet, bready malts are present in the nose. It also seems like there are some notes of adjuncts such as corn.
T: The taste follows the smell, but none of the adjunct aromas that I picked up in the nose are perceptible in the taste. There are some hints of metallic flavors and ginger. Light amounts of grassy hops are also noticeable, but these don't contribute any bitterness and mostly serve to mask any sweetness that you might expect from the malts.
M: It feels light-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This beer isn't that bad and doesn't feel that light or watery on the palate. There are also just enough hops to mask any sweetness from the taste.

Feel- softly carbonated and light.
This one has its moments. It does not have the adjunct tastes of macro lagers yet it doesn't have the hoppiness of a German Pilsner, which makes me wonder about its classification. Regardless, it is an ok beer that will pair well with Asian food.Dec 20, 2015"

Kloud Original Gravity,4.5,3.25,3.25,3.5,"A: Yellowy gold with a big off-white head. Heaving with small, sparkling bubbles and looks very champagney. Leaves a nice bit of lacing.

S: Peppy kind of yeastiness and notes of dull malt and, er, river-bed silt.

T: In character it’s a German Pilsener lager, albeit a low-end one. It has a soft caramelised malt backbone with some subtle vanilla in the midst and an intermittent citrus finish. You know what, there’s a subtle hint of blackberry in there too. Unfortunately it has a touch of Eurolager dirtiness and corn snacks cheapness. It should be noted that its a terrible palate cleanser and its off flavours really stand out between fuller flavoured beers.

M: The mouthfeel is very soft.

Chang Beer,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,"Review: 330 ml Bottle of Chang Beer Export: ABV: 5%

With a nice logo of two big elephants facing each other on its label, Chang is the Thai word for elephant, an important animal in Thailand as a symbol of both power and peace.

On pour we get a nice clear yellow colour, with a big frothy white head that is decent enough, and which settles down but maintains. A lot of carbonation, very bubbly and lively

No real lacing.

Overall, not a bad looking beer

On the nose I get an initial sweet piercing smell of lemon but overall not so strong, very faint.

A beery smell, sweet grains, hay, lemon, malts, all good on the nose, but as I mentioned not so strong.....

Taste is bittersweet, soft, clean and relatively easy to drink. Some light grains, but not enough to really get excited about.

Bit of an aftertaste, all bitter. Stringent sweet malts

Too sweet for my liking, and the tastes are not well balanced.

Not a great beer, very little to actually taste. Ok it is a little sessionable, but overall it is not really enjoyable. Bland. I am not a fan.

Apparently the home brew version is meant to be better than the export version, brewed with rice rather than malt, and is a 6.4% strength lager. Perhaps another inspection is needed, on a beach in Pattaya supping an ice cold beer enjoying the sun......Oct 28, 2016"

Chang Beer,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Cosmos Brewery ""Chang""
12 oz. brown glass bottle, ""BEST BEFORE: 082815""
$1.79 @ Total Wine & More, Claymont, DE

Chang is interesting in that it's got a very grainy/malty and nutty character to it. In the aroma it's so strong that you'd probably think it was ""off"" if you'd never had it before. Most people expect it to be a thin, fizzy golden adjunct lager, but it's actually much more than that, and made from 100% malted barley (and to note, this is the standard exported product, not the one labeled as export, which is also 100% malted barley). 

The grainy character then follows into the flavor with toffee and honey-like notes rising. After a few sips you get used to the idea that it's not a fizzy yellow beer, and if you're like me, find it interesting and unique. It's malty, almost like a Munich helles with a bit of nuttiness and light caramel thrown in. With that said, it does lean a bit towards sweetness, although it never quite gets there and finishes dry. If you're looking for hops, however, they're not here, nor is their bitterness. A pleasant bit of floral and leafy hops make their way through the malt but they never shine.

An interesting and unique ""world lager"" that I'm guessing probably has a German brewer somewhere in its history. Worth trying!Jun 30, 2015"

Chang Beer,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,"Taste similar to its other Thailand counterpart Singha. Very easy drinking like most Lagers. Nothing offensive or out of the ordinary with this one. This is a session type of lager.Jun 26, 2015"
Chang Beer,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,"The beer pours out into a Duvel glass a bright clear yellow color with a 1/2"" white head that soon recedes to a thin layer of foam with a bit of an irregular island over part of the surface. Sipping leaves scattered small and medium patches of foam that slowly recedes to the liquid. There are also a few legs of lacing.

The aroma is sweet, almost of honey bit without hops showing.

The flavors match the nose in that there's light sweetness and no bitterness.

The mouth feel is crisp and on the light side of medium and there is some slightly prickly carbonation for at least part of the beer. During the medium length finish the sweetness tends to fade, but there isn't much dryness to speak of, just no sweetness.

Overall, this is pretty average, but is the type of thing that many would find refreshing on a hot, humid day.

Overall this is a drinkable beer with no unpleasant feature but nothing particularly notable either. For me, its not something I'll be seeking out in the future as I do like noticeable hops in my beer.Jun 23, 2015"

Chang Beer,3.0,3.0,2.75,2.75,"Sampling right now on 4/21/15. Comes in a 330ml (11.2 ounce) bottle. From the Cosmos Brewery (Thai Beverage Plc.) in Bangkok, Thailand. Bottle chilled down down to 36 degrees F in my beer cooler and poured to a flute glass.

Brew pours a pale straw-yellow in color with a very thin white head. Really no lacing to mention except for a small amount when sipped that slides back down the sides of the glass. The aroma is just of some sweet grains that is slightly 'musty', like wet hay. Pretty much is said for the taste. Nothing else stands out for the taste. Not bitter or harsh aftertaste though. Finishes slightly crisp and dry even. Really nothing special but worth a try since how many brews from Thailand have you tried? Yeah exactly. Lighter-bodied with good carbonation. Overall it was just OK.Apr 21, 2015"
Chang Beer,3.0,2.5,1.5,2.5,"Decided to give it a try, what the heck. I actually kind of enjoyed Singha.

Pours a very pale gold, light straw. A crisp and quickly dissipating white head. Nothing special but it is a nice color.

Smells…like damp hay and raw grain. Slightly sweet in a white bread sort of way. A bit musty, like an old barn after a gentle rain… pasture-y.

Taste is pretty bland. Nothing really that stands out overall. It tastes slightly like it smells. Of damp hay and raw grain. It has a mineral sort of quality to it. Something that reminds of me Perrier sparkling water. It is light enough that I actually seem to get a hint of alcohol. The sweet, grain like undertone is most prominent overall.

Mouthfeel is okay, a bit tacky. Crisp… but oddly tacky. It is light… it is fizzy.

Overall, I would stick with Singha if I were to have a run of the mill Asian beer. Though f you were desperate and in need of a beer abroad, this would do. It makes me think a lot of drinking San Miguel when I was traveling in Spain. It is just beer and should probably be consumed no more than one on a hot day.Apr 11, 2015"

Yes, some 10$ micro brews achieve the same result , but when I open a 10$ per bottle local brew, I expect it to be better, otherwise what's the point.

The head started fluffy white and prevented me from getting a full bottle into the glass in a single try, even on a fairly light pour.

Nose is as expected with banana and an somewhat earthy sorta spice - coriander. There's a little bit of mineral to soapy note like some say of cilantro, but it is missing the herbal aspect of the leafys. Taste brings the mineral water backed by the coriander, with the wheat banana note being a very light platform for these to dance across. A little bit of white pepper joins by mid-taste, and I think it sorta counters and quells an slight increase in banana flavor.

The feel is fairly thin, and there's more carbonation than I expected. There's more heft and smoothness than a seltzer, but my mind did drift to that drink as I tried to figure this beer out. The back end is actually pretty dry.

Hoegaarden Original White Ale,3.75,3.25,3.5,3.75,"It's hoegaarden, if you haven't tried one you definitely should but don't expect it to be the best Belgian wheat beer you've ever had. A few decades ago before the craft beer surge this was probably an upper echelon beer, but in the last decade brewing has come a long way and left InBev beers like this in the dust. 

Pours a slightly hazy straw gold. Well carbonated and spritz-y. Traditional flavors of coriander and orange peel are present but muted, probably InBev's doing. Finishes light but watery. Aftertaste doesn't linger long. This is significantly better than comparably priced beers such as Miller or Bluemoon, but that's not saying much. Surprising to see so many 4+ reviews on this, even some perfect 5s.

Taste of wheat, lemon (as I added a slice of lemon to it) and hint of spices, , touch of clove, very little to no bitterness and is full bodied and hearty but like a lot of wheat beers is slightly bland. Whilst added lemon or lime to lager is a sin, citrus definitely enhances the flavour profile of this beer. Finish is vaguely citrus acid and dry, slightly cloying when drunk quickly but not unpleasantly so. 

It's a pleasant easy drinker and definitely a must try but I'm sure it was a bit tastier 20 years or so ago when it was all the rage with Cardiff metropolitans. You were always disappointed if they ran out of the special Hoegaarden glasses and served it to you in a regular pint glass.

Crisp and refreshing taste with hints of floral hops, sweet pale malt, finishing with a mild lemon hint and some low oxidation.
Watery body with good carbonation.
Adjunct lager a bit above average, hops are mild but they can be sensed and adjuncts are on the low side and probably rice rather than corn.Dec 19, 2013"
Hite,2.25,2.25,2.25,2.5,"Had in Beijing.
355ml can pored into a pint glass.
Born on date: 3/19/13
ABV: 4.5%
Ingredients list water, barley, and hops.

A- Golden-yellow. Moderate carbonation. 

S- Faint hint of wet grain. Not much of a nose on this one. 

T- A little grain gives way to a metallic aftertaste. 

M- Super smooth, good carbonation. Crisp finish. 

I was looking forward to this after not seeing any adjuncts listed in the ingredients.I was let down when I experienced just another bland, mass-produced Asian lager. The can states: ""Clean & Pure!"" as well as ""Freezing Point Filtration System."" It is surely clean and pure, but they seem to have filtered out the beer flavor.Jul 29, 2013"
Hite,1.75,1.25,1.5,1.5,"Hite? A Korean beer that was purchased in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Huh, go figure.

Well, in an endeavor to be a goo beer advocate and try everything new I can find, I was in a Korean food store in the dead center of South America and encountered Hite.

It's notable the that ""cold meter"" on the bottle label has apparently reached Korea, and my bottle indicated that it was the appropriate time to drink. Unfortunately there were no cups available to see the beer to evaluate it properly. But it was obviously the golden/pale lager color. Smell was dull at best, and taste followed suit. Hite gives you the effervescent sensation as any other mass produced lager. Would I drink it again? Not a chance. The only uniqueness to this beer is that it's the only Korean beer I've ever had.May 22, 2013"
Hite,2.0,2.25,2.75,2.25,"A: Pours all white head at first, angrily sizzling. After a little while the uneven head is almost gone, replaced by pale golden liquid. Only poor lacings.

S: Very light in smell; some detergent-like malts, sweet, together with rice. Only very faint hoppy bitterness. 

T: Rather smooth and well balanced in taste. Don't get me wrong, this is a mild macro-beer, but considering that, not too shabby. Malt and some bitter hops together with a little rice, makes this a soft-tasting beer.

M: Short aftertaste, a bit bitter. Body is light and carbontion is strong and aggresive.

O: This is a poor product with a big adjunct-vibe to it. If that's what you're into, this could be gold, otherwise - avoid!Apr 12, 2013"
Hite,2.5,2.75,2.0,1.5,"12oz bottle from a sampler, poured into a pint glass. I mistook this beer for an adjunct, probably should have used a more tapered glass. 

Beer pours very thin, head is more reminiscent of 7-up than lager. No lacing, very light in color. Smell is slightly better than expected given its appearance. Something unusual in the smell - akin to bathtub gin. Mash? 

Taste is poor, mouthfeel is downright awful. Only redeeming quality is a faint sweetness that helps it avoid a skunky flavor. 

Honestly, this was one of the worst beers I've consumed. When I think about my least favorite beers, this ranks better than only Corona and perhaps Bud Select.Feb 05, 2013"

Max hite,2.75,2.5,2.5,2.5,"From a can purchased in Seoul. Golden color with white head. Sweet grain smell. Light body. Tastes like it smells, sweet grain with some corn and earthiness. Below average, but drinkable enough. Makes me think the other reviews are a freshness issue.Apr 05, 2019"
Max hite,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"I got Max at the Korean Air lounge in the Incheon International Airport. 

It was from a machine where you place the glass and it tilts and pours for you. The color was a urine-yellow, and the head almost felt coarse. The whole time I was drinking Max, I felt like I was drinking metal. There was an overarching metallic smell and flavor that took away everything else from a forgettable experience.Aug 20, 2015"
Max hite,2.0,2.25,1.75,1.75,"11.13(?)oz bottle purchased at the north Spokane Total Wine for a price I forget. I purchased this solely as a ticker beer, as I'd never had a Korean beer before. I didn't notice the ""04032013"" stamp until today, so this beer is definitely past it's prime (and once again, way to go re: freshness, Total Wine).

Poured into a Jever Pilsener glass, this was a chill-hazed, slightly amberish golden color, with a miniscule white head that receeded to a thin collar in seconds. Despite the lack of head there's lots and lots of bubbles arcing skyward. No lace at all.

Big, crude grainy aroma and hints of white wine, so 50% what I expected and 50% WTF.

Grainy malts with a side of diacetyl. Yum...

Light bodied, but not as light as it should be. Lousily low level of carbonation.

Pretty awful, in part due to age, no doubt, but I don't think there was much chance of anything commendable even if fresh. Oh, well, I'm a little closer to my dorky goal of having at least one beer from every brewing country on Earth.May 03, 2015"

Max hite,3.25,2.5,2.25,3.0,"Poured from 12oz can into a pint glass. The can says this is made from all-malt, so perhaps it should fall into the pale lager category, rather than adjunct lager?

Appearance: golden hue with a haze-free body and a strong effervescence. Head is a finger of quickly-subsiding white foam. Not bad, for the style.

Smell: sweet with a definite corn pops character thrown in the mix. The can says all-malt, but it does indeed smell quite adjunct-y. Not great, but relatively free of off-putting aromas.

Taste: like the aroma, it's quite sweet with a hint of corn, but really it's not too bad. Nothing I would go out of my way to get, but as the style goes, there's at least a little flavor here. One unfortunate area is hops, though -- they are not at all distinguishable. Points lost for that.

Mouthfeel: light body but a big carbonation with a good creaminess for the style.

Overall: quite drinkable, although it's not an inspirational beer by any means. Still, for an adjunct lager in a can, you can do a lot worse.Feb 15, 2014"

Miller Genuine Draft,4.5,3.5,2.75,2.75,"Bought this beer because I was looking for something cheap and refreshing on a hot day. Pounded the first one straight from the bottle and felt nothing. Thought I'd look to see how much alcohol was in this stuff and landed here. Poured my second into the closest thing i have to a pilsner glass and began my review. I got a thick head over an inch which lasted about 2 minutes. Color is pale with a lively effervescence and very clear. This beer looks great. Disappearing head left a nice lacing of froth on the sides of my glass. Not much smell. Maybe a little metallic with a slight earthy aroma. Definitely has a metallic aftertaste with a little bit of bitter. Not much taste at all while its going down. This is not a very exciting beer and you'll have to drink it very quickly if you want a buzz from it. This is a good beer to enjoy cold with some BBQ and friends before undertaking some sort of summertime activity that requires you to not be overly sedated. I don't recommend drinking more than 2 per sitting. Afterwards go do something to work off that 144 calories per bottle. On sale for 18 bucks for 20, I'd just as soon drink PBR which is a little less expensive and probably a little more flavorful. Still, I think this beer deserves better than it seems to get around here. It has it's time and place. I'm glad we drank this stuff as teenagers because if we had stronger beers like are common now, we might not have survived.Jun 28, 2021"

poured a 1finger head into glass that quickly disappeared. but left a lace as I was drinking it

Say what you will, but I find it easy to drink (out of a bottle... no cans, here) and reminiscent of rural weddings where - while they did have champagne - this champagne of beers was probably almost as good, and it went with everything there as it does on a hot Wisconsin day. Maybe it is nostalgia, but this slightly honey-colored brew that smells of little and has just a bit of effervescence is a simple beer for a simple man.May 10, 2021"
Miller Genuine Draft,1.25,1.25,1.25,1.25,"(January 2005). Seriously struck by rating addiction, I bought this beer only to rate it - and I hate myself for it! Hate hate hate!! I paid good money for this crap, in the US at least it’s cheap - here it’s expensive. Importing this shit to Europe is totally ridiculous! And the alternative in Norway, if you want an American beer, is Bud!! (If you’re ’lucky’, you might find Michelob!) My expectations were very low, but I soon found out that this ’beer’ was even worse than I expected. Aroma reminiscent of the wine yeast of my disastrous, short lived wine-making career 15 years ago. Excessive head that disappears rather quickly. Hardly any flavour at all - just a bland, metallic mouthfeel. Luckily, there is no aftertaste either (if there was, it would surely have been bad). ’Genuine draught’ my ass! This is just bad, real BAD!!May 03, 2021"

Miller Genuine Draft,5.0,2.5,2.5,4.0,"Straight outta the gate, I'm not a big fan of Miller products, finding the majority of them too light and smacking of adjuncts.
I purchased MGD for the first time because I'd be drinking a few with some BBQ and simply wanted something lighter and frankly, cheap.

Surprisingly, MGD wasn't bad. Nice ""beery"" yellow-gold. Head lasted down to the bottom of the glass! 
Light malt nose with light grassy hops peeping through. Taste exactly like the nose, only with a mild corn aftertaste.

Pours a clear pale yellow... not exactly appetizing in color. However the head is thick and bubbly, retains well, and laces well too. It really does look like it came from a draught, but that color...

Smell is faint corn and not much else. Taste has the corn for sure but the grains and barley show up too. The finish is a bit sweet. I really don’t get much in the way of hops. I know they’re there, but if I didn’t know, I might have asked where the hops were.

Feel is light and highly carbonated, and crisp at first, but the sweet corn in the finish leaves it just a little chewy.

Overall - I’d gladly take this over a lot of other macro brews, and I wouldn’t hesitate if it was handed to me at a barbecue or whatever. Price point is also hard to beat ($9.99 for a 12 pack). Even with that said, this sits just north of “awful” for me.Dec 21, 2020"

I saw this in the store for $11 for a 12 pack and figured it would be worth trying out and comparing to the other Miller products. I gotta say, this is pretty good! It kind of tastes like a well aerated Miller High Life but with more of a crisp and clean finish than its predecessor. I think this tops High Life. The bottle has a cool black label, the flavor is good and refreshing, it's carbonated but pretty chuggable, and its just as cheap as High Life. It's certainly no Rising Tide Back Cove pilsner or Sierra Nevada pale ale, but it's a god amongst macro adjunct lagers.Jun 28, 2020"
Miller Genuine Draft,4.0,2.75,1.75,2.0,"From the can, it pours a clear pale yellow color. A large foam head displays good retention and a persistent film throughout; lots of lacing. 

The nose displays notes of corn adjunct. Aromas of bready and grainy malt display some sweetness, however, it is somewhat overshadowed by notes of sour lemon and green apples.

The taste opens with flavors of grainy and bready malt that display moderate sweetness. However, as with the aroma, there is a touch of lemon and apple like tartness that is a bit off putting. There is little to no discernible hops flavor or bitterness. Light bodied with a carbonation that is on par, thankfully not too fizzy. The mouthfeel is somewhat coarse but smooths out. The finish is dry with hints of corn.

I only had 1/3rd of this 32oz can and used the rest for baking. I was turned off by the sour flavor. This is a hard pass for me next time.May 27, 2020"

Miller Genuine Draft,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Whether I buy this or Hamm's at the store depends on a) whether I can find Hamm's--it's not everywhere in the midwest--or b) is Labatt's Blue available? I find the ratings here confusing: is MGD really worse than Miller High Life? The ingredients and brewing process are better. Note to Miller: stop using hop extract for MGD, please. The family and I did a taste test of four Miller products, and this won, I perceive the 55 score as a judgment of its quality against much better beer. As an American Adjunct Lager, it's awfully good.

Update 5/22/20: I'm bumping it down to 3.5 across the board. It's still quite good, and I will drink it with pleasure, but the aforementioned Hamm's is almost as good and easier on the wallet, while MGD doesn't compare to the beers above it in my hierarchy. If you're at a gas station and every choice is American lager? Yeah, go for it. If you're in a bar? Sure, why not? You could do worse for three bucks a bottle.

Miller Genuine Draft,5.0,4.75,5.0,4.75,"Great, Classic and Old School American Lager.
First let me shed some light behind the reason this Beer gets such bad reviews on this type of website. Miller Genuine Draft, Like many other classic Beers (IE: Coors, Budweiser, Pabst) is despised by the online community because they simply don't understand the intentions of these lagers. Miller is a well made Lager. Made for enjoying a Meal, enjoying a get-together, A Party, or what have you. These Lagers are not made to scrutinize or pick apart. They are simple, Malt forward and approachable. These Lagers have been around for a long time, and People still drink them and enjoy them. Now Segway into my thoughts on this beer.
Beginning with the Looks, This beer is Super clear, Bright Straw yellow with the slightest hints of gold. I didn't bother pouring into a glass. Ok moving on to Smell. The aroma is very Malt forward and yeasty. much like good home baked Bread. Nice soft sweetness to the nose. Now for flavor. I was surprised, it tastes nothing like High life! Of course, like all American Lagers you get Malt in the front. This beer is Up-front Softly sweet and Malty with a distinct lingering malt flavor that makes this beer like no other. This Lager is truly different. the flavors carry over into a nice clean middle and end. Hops are mostly undetectable but add balance. Now for feel. Pillowy and somewhat creamy. Medium light body, and good carbonation. Overall, Im impressed that this Lager is different than the rest! I think it tastes better than High Life! Worth a try, if you like a Classic American Lager.Dec 25, 2019"

The mouthfeel is watery, thin bodied, highly carbonated and semi dry in the finish. Overall, ok. There are better tasting AAL out there for the money.

A - Pours a crystal clear straw yellow with a one finger head thanks to a hard pour that faded to leave a thin white halo and a nice cloud.

S - Smell is average, lots of sweet malts and rice. None of the corn that comes with American adjunct lagers thanks to the rice. A nice rice aroma too but its fleeting.

T - Tastes of more of the sweet malts with an almost german spice/pilsner quality to it. There is a slight earthyness with some faint rice and a nice dry finish.

I had to settle for a can from Publix. By the way, bonus points for the insanely sturdy can. If I ever get in to a bar fight, screw the bottles, give me a Sapporo! The beer doesn't have the same constitution as the can though. It's comparable to your average domestic macro lager. Pours with a transparent, fizzy yellow-water appearance with active carbonation and several inches of nice, frothy, snow-white foam. Quality lacing remains as the snow cap cover gradually melts away. The mild, unoffensive aroma whispers of soft grain. Not much going on in the nose. Traces of hops, and perhaps a touch of fruitiness. Super clean. The first sip has me thinking of cork. A husky cork-like flavor and a little woody accent ride over mild malt sweetness. A bit dry, with an interesting complimentary bitterness. Nicely balanced with a clean finish that hints at white rice in the aftertaste. Adequate body and carbonation produce a light but respectable texture.

It's somewhat vegetal but not sloppily so with grains that, while prominent, don't domineer or go that oddly astringent direction that some beers can take. There's a bit of bright, fairly sweet citrus and a kiss of something floral. All in all, for a style that certainly seems like a weaker one, this holds down as average.

Sapporo Original Draft Beer,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,"BOTTOM LINE: This is a light lager that tastes like most other light lagers. A little aluminum-y tasting. Mostly clean. Good mouthfeel with moderate carbonation.

This is a good beer to have with sushi, because it does not have too much flavor to detract from the delicate flavors of the fish. A slight hint of hops, a slight bit of malt, something that reminds me of lemon (that might be the aluminum), and a little bit reminiscent of tea. 

This is my go to Sake Bomb beer, for what it's worth.Dec 05, 2013"

Taste was creamy sweet corn and rice with a hop notice. As the brew settles or warms the malts come forward.

The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, grain, subtle banana, and very subtle fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew was not really anything to get excited about. This is basically the BMC of Japan I'm guessing and it lets you know this with similar flavors.

A - The sexy-looking can releases pale straw yellow beer with moderate carbonation and brilliant clarity. The white head fades quickly with but a few fingers of lace creeping up the glass.

S - Just the simple crispness of the aroma is inviting. Not off-putting in the least but certainly open and airy, dry dusty straw, pale malt, and, of course, rice completes the aroma.

T - Sweetness stems from pale and pils malt in the taste that's accented by straw and rice. Much less dusty than the nose foreshadowed.

M - Crisp, clean, and most importantly, refreshing, Sapporo is light-bodied and biting with carbonation but smooth regardless.

O - Predominant rice additions don't hinder this defect-free beer for me. For the style, it's delicious and damn if it isn't refreshing after a long day at work. Thank you sir, may I have another?Aug 15, 2011"

My can is not from Mexico it was brewed by Molson Coors In Canada.
So maybe there will be a difference from the original beer.
The beer taste very light not much bitterness and just a plain malty hint of lemon taste .
Very easy to drink thought it was gonna be crappy beer but it's actually ok and an average beer to drink .
Maybe Molson Coors did the better job brewing this beer then the original from Mexico.

Sol,1.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,"Sol Cerveza is one of those Corona knockoffs that seem to be popping up left and right in an attempt to gain a foothold in the light easy drinking, adjunct lager category. You know going in this isn't a beer that's for connoisseurs, and is only there to fulfill a market of people who either don't drink beer or people just wanting to knock back a seemingless endless supply of liquid in the hope it gets them drunk and not bloated. This 650ml long neck of Mexican beer, is apparently imported from the Netherlands into Australia, for Pinnacle Drinks which is basically Woolworths alcohol importer. Isn't globalisation great?! 

Look: Poured into a pint glass. Extremely carbonated. Hundreds if not thousands of bubbles surround the interior of the glass, and plenty racing their way to the surface in search of freedom or a better life than my stomach. Bubbly white head that disappears before you know it. Head look promising, but non existent after 30 seconds, giving an appearance of golden soda water. Straw gold, completely filtered can see right through the glass. Standard adjunct lager look to it, nothing to write home about. The head dissipating in seconds, is disappointing. 

Smell: Classic Mexican/Central American adjunct beer smell. Corn, light citrus notes, stale white bread, but not a great deal going on. 

Taste: Taste follows the nose. Very thin body. Very sweet, very smooth almost no bitterness to speak of. Maybe some light hop extract, but nothing to exactly write home about. Pretty bland, there's a weird chemical roundness to the overall flavour. 

Feel: Highly carbonated, thin body , slight dry finish. Highly drinkable if you're just wanting to knock these back without tasting anything. 

Overall: I'm not knocking it because I don't think it's good. i'm knocking it, because unless I'm lying on a tropical beach somewhere for it to quench a thirst, it's not doing anything for me. Outside of a hot environment where you're relaxing and just drinking for a buzz, it's not worth the effort and the carbs. It's a summer beach beer that'll help get the taste of salt water or chlorine (if you're in a pool) out of your mouth. Nothing more, nothing less.Aug 23, 2021"

Flavor: Flavor too is of pale cereal and a nice milky, pale malt sweetness. Like frosted flakes soaked in milk. Not sweet, but the sweetness is appreciated (3.75)

Feel: Medium to fuller bodied for the style. Decent carbonation. Finishes smooth with a touch of creaminess. (4.00)

Compared to Corona 4/16/20: Pours a slightly darker color with a heavier head. Stronger aromas. Hard to compare b/c this Corona was oxidized, but it has more grain sweetness and less skunk, that's about all I can say. Winner: Sol

Overall: A very smooth and clean drinking AAL. This one was better than I expected. Nice cereal grain and milk flavors. Not a whole lot of German malts. It even beat Corona side-by-side. I may pick this one up again if I get a chance. (Final Rating: 3.83)Apr 17, 2020"

Coming in a light long necked bottle with the iconic sun logo of Sol, eye catching. This is a summer drink no doubt about it! Looks similar to Corona in its presentation and style, I thought it was when I initially looked at it! Can get it in cans too, but not sure for tap.

It is a beach time beer anyhow, Acapulco style, dont know how it will work though in the Northern European wet and cold harsh climate, but let’s see………

Through the bottle it looks a light yellow, but on pour we do get a nice sparkling golden colour with a very frothy creamy white head, a nice good bit of carbonation fizzing away. Some lacing present as well.

Looks ok, like a regular light lager would. Head maintains well. Surprisingly good on the eye.

A light lagery aroma which isn’t too bad on the nose getting the corn, and the grains. Ok.

On the taste it is very, very light, initially getting a creamy flavour, bit dry in the mouth as well.

Slight aftertaste of corn syrup which is not enjoyable. 

This is a very light lager, but it has a dryness and a bit of a metallic feel to it that lets it down. 
Overall it is not nice, and not as smooth as it should be.

Bit of an underlay taste and a harsh citric bitterness that’s annoying. A pass for me. A nothing beer.Nov 29, 2019"

Taste - There's nothing wrong with it but it's also a very basic beer. It's sort of like a house beer at a restaurant, something that is clean and crisp but not much in the way of flavor. Follows the nose with the corn sweetness. Carbonation is medium-high. Drinkability is very high like most Mexican lagers.

So leave the Singapore Gin Sling for the chicks - be a Tiger!May 06, 2021"
Tiger Beer,4.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Tiger Asian Lager is crystal clear and pale amber in color, pretty much the color of ripe hay. The head is rocky, bone white, and surprisingly lasting for the style.
At first blush, Tiger's aroma is sweet and appropriately malty for a pale lager. Meaning it's pale grains combined with crackers and a general sort of breadiness. There's also an up front sweetness that at first seems generic in its sugariness. Then, the center comes along and confirms the presence of corn adjuncts. The sweetness literally reminds me of corn syrup. The finish is also short and sweet, fading quickly into nothing.
My first impression is of a beer that is smooth and rounded, but that impression doesn't last long. It quickly becomes sweet with flavors of corn syrup that thankfully stops short of being cloying. There may be a hint of soda cracker in there, but the corn adjuncts make it hard to pick out. As with the aroma, the flavor ends on a sweet note.
It could be a half decent lager but the corn adjuncts dominate too much to the beer's detriment. If it even had some dryness in its flavor profile that would help cut the beer's overall sweetness. But sadly, no such luck.Apr 03, 2021"

Tiger Beer,3.5,3.0,3.75,3.75,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a clear golden color with a one finger head of white foam. The head has an amazing level of retention, very slowly fading over time to leave a bit of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is a mix of mustiness, graininess and some sweeter caramel. Along with these smells comes a little bit of a light peach and apricot sweetness.
Taste – The taste begins with a sweeter caramel and an almost candy corn like sweetness with some lighter bready flavors. These tastes create the bulk flavor of the brew and remain rather strong throughout. The sweetness does transition a bit however, gaining some more honey and candy corn like flavors at the expense of the caramel. All the while, there is a touch of herbal hop and a small transitioning of the bready to a more doughy taste, leaving one with a sweeter, but pleasant and still crisp taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is medium to slightly lighter with a carbonation level that is rather average. While a bit more carbonation may have been slightly more fitting for the sweeter tastes, the medium body and feel is great for the flavor profile, and makes for one nice easy drinker.
Overall – A brew fit for a nice hot summer day. Easy drinking, slightly sweeter, and still rather refreshing. Nice overall.Jul 21, 2020"

Can find it as 5% vol. in other regions of the world. Comes in a bottle, can or from the tap. Popular in Asia especially as it is the perfect beer to have as the sun goes down.

Unlike a lot of other Asian beers, Tiger actually use quality ingredients from Australia and Europe. No shitty rice beers here!

Love the famous iconic branding, the famous tiger logo and nice big colourful lettering, the blue, orange and gold. Stands out for sure. On the bottle we get ""World acclaimed Asian lager”, born in Singapore and this is an “award winning full bodied beer”. 

On the pour I am getting a nice clear golden coloured beer with a white head that is a little on the small side. Some slight carbonation. Ok on the looks. 

The aroma is not great, very light, an ok lagery smell, all malty and grainy on the nose but too light and a little too much corn and very sweet.

The taste is easy enough to appreciate, was very soft on the tongue, nice and crisp.

Nice frothy mouthfuls initially, and also getting some corn in the taste.

Tasted like a regular lager, no real complaints there. Perhaps a little creamy off taste but generally it was ok. Getting the malts and grains, and the fruits, with the hops on the low level.

To be frank I was a little disappointed as the overall taste was ok but nothing too exciting, a bit bland in fact, nothing to set it apart from the millions of lagers out there. Disappointed as I have had this beer many a time when I was in Asia. In fact it was my most favourite beer that side of the world, lovely from the taps. I just guess it doesn't travel well, and not so exciting in a bottle thousands of miles away from home. Perfect for the hot humid Asian cityscape, not so when its piddling down in bog town Ireland!

Overall it was light, smooth and drinkable but with no kick or standout features. Boring.Nov 22, 2019"
Tiger Beer,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,".9oz can poured into 14oz teku. Poured a clean, clear light honey color with an inch-and-a-half of fluffy white head that good retention and lacing.

The aroma was that of basic ""beer""; slightly sweet malts, low hops, and no yeast. Same on the tongue, just a beer. The body was, as expected, thin and smooth, and had a semi-sweet finish. Drinkability was fine, but I won't be having another. Overall, try it for the tick, or, if you're into the style, try it to enjoy it.Nov 03, 2019"
Tiger Beer,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Appearance: Pours a clear, light golden color with a mild white head. SRM of 7. (3.50)

Aroma: Light and clean aromas of corn, fresh white bread. A touch of husk. Some white cracker dissolving-in-your-mouth sweetness with wet rice. Very light on the aroma as expected. (3.50)

Flavor: Light on the tongue too. Just very mild and clean lager yeast. A touch of white cracker, corn, topped with pepper. Finishes extremely clean. (3.50)

Feel: Medium-bodied for the style. Average carbonation. Pretty standard for a pale lager. Finishes clean and balanced on the palate. (3.75)

Compared to Stella Arterois 7/6/21: Pours a lighter color. Slightly more dry and bready yeast. Less cracker and lemonflower. A fuller body. 

Overall: Like it or leave it, there's just not a lot here. Very clean. Nearly no flavor. As much as I want to like this lager for its clean profile, there's just not enough here for me. (Final Rating: 3.48)Nov 02, 2019"
Tiger Beer,2.75,2.5,2.75,2.5,"Poured from a 330ml bottle. It has a clear golden body with a small white head with poor retention.

Has a faint, kind of a dusty aroma of pale malts.

The taste is pale malts, with some bitterness and a hint of citrusy sweetness. Dry aftertaste.

Really watery, to be honest.Oct 16, 2019"
Tiger Beer,3.5,2.0,2.75,2.5,"From a bottle, pours as a clear gold with lots of carbonation and a white frothy quickly dispersing head. Aroma is minimal, but bread(y). Taste is sweet malt-forward, but again mild. A slight hops bitterness balances the malt, but there is also a slight metallic aftertaste, Mouth-feel is hollow and watery.

Tiger Beer,1.25,1.0,1.25,1.25,"This is such an overrated and terrible beer. The reason why the people in this region drinks it regularly is just simply they have no knowledge of other beers. It almost has no aroma and its taste is so bland.Jul 28, 2019"

S: rather typical spicy-yeasty doughy aromas, maybe a bit of orange peel, hint of flowery grass... not much umpf to intensity

T: dry, bready-doughy malty base, with some faint clove/bubblegum esters cutting above... not much bitterness, sweetness, or lasting flavors through the finish... solid, dry malt; bitterness barely accents - little else

F: bit of a bouncy chub up front; it quietly floats away... dry all around; no contour to its body at all

O: had potential, no glaring flaws, but in the end relatively weak on the attack; rather bland... the little extra malt up front is noteworthy for a second, but it leads nowhere... designed to be swilled ice cold, I'm sure (1402)Jul 16, 2019"

Tiger Beer,4.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,"0 ml bottle into lager glass, 6259702 bottle code. Pours crystal clear medium golden yellow color with a 1 finger dense and rocky off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey/pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Touch of fruity aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice and pleasant aromas with pale malts and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey/pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, floral, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey/pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great robustness and balance of pale malts and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with no fruity/yeasty notes. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium-plus carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5%. Overall this is a delicious Euro pale lager. All around nice robustness and balance of pale malts and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. Very flavorful and not watery for the ABV. Great clean pils malt showcase, and nice noble hop presence/balance for the style. A very enjoyable offering, and outstanding style example.

Stout,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Canned on date 12/22/20 and enjoyed in a 16oz Founders snifter on 10/15/21.
Appearance: Pours a dark brown almost black with a finger of khaki medium brown colored foam. Great head retention and nice lacing as the foam dissipates
Smell: Deep complex roasted coffee malts with associated bitterness. The bitterness is balanced out with lovely notes of chocolate and earthiness and a bit of oat flavor. Subtle bourbon flavors of vanilla and oak as well. I will admit that it’s frustrating to get these complex coffee chocolate aromas and not be able to describe but I’ll leave it at that. 

Taste: Coffee bitterness with subtle notes of chocolate and earthy notes. The oats and chocolate really help balance and support the coffee flavors. Bourbon flavors are more present in the nose but subtle in the taste along with some caramel. 

Feel: Minimal carbonation and its hard to over-estimate the creamy smooth mouth-feel. Slight alcohol warmness, but it helps bring out the bourbon flavors and it’s kinda expected considering the above average abv of 8.3%. 

Overall: A bit more bitter than I remember, but I appreciate a beer that doesn’t over-rely on sweet desert taste to mask the higher abv disappear. Would definitely buy again!Yesterday at 06:33 AM"
Stout,3.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Look: Black in color with a thin head that quickly dissipates. Relatively minimal lacing on the glass.

Smell: Coffee and roasted malt dominate the smell, with chocolate lurking in the background.

Taste: Dark coffee forward, malt, and a touch of chocolate, but mostly coffee and malt. Even though this is 60 IBU's and has a higher ABV, the taste and finish is surprisingly low on bitterness, and is much more sweet than I was expecting which was a pleasant surprise.

Feel: Relatively smooth with some very light carbonation.

Overall: This is one of the best stouts I have had to date. Founder's really knocked it out of the park with this one, and I was pleasantly surprised by the low bitterness. Only things I would change would be a larger and creamier head, along with a more chocolate forward taste instead of coffee; however that's just my preference. Definitely a stout I'd recommend to others!Wednesday at 02:25 AM"
Stout,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"I bought this one on a whim. I love stoats, especially spiced, coffee, and chocolate one, so i figured I’d give this one a try. I was so pleasantly surprised.

Feel: Slightly oily. Perfect amount of carbonation.
Overall: Excellent, well balanced stout.Aug 01, 2021"
Stout,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.75,"Founders Breakfast Stout is an amazing beer that luckily can be found widely.

Poured from a bottle in a 4 pack into a traditional pint glass, the stout pours deep black with a slight umber cast around the margins. A head barely forms before disappearing to the edges creating a ring of light cream that lasted until around half way through the drink. The edge thins to create a dark umber ring as I tip the glass back for a drink. 

The stout smells mainly of coffee and dark chocolate with slight hints of caramel and malt. The taste is supremely balanced which is why this beer is highly rated. Immediately the coffee and chocolate hit on the front. I was anticipating a bitter or alcohol taste (due to the higher than average alcohol content) when the flavor moved back but that never happened. The coffee, roast, and chocolate continued all the way through and left a slightly spiced aftertaste.

The stout feels medium thickness but not creamy due to its low carbonation. Swooshing the the beer in my mouth it does have a creamier feel as the little amount of carbonation in the beer comes out. 

Overall, this beer is packed with flavor and has nearly no negatives as long as one enjoys coffee and chocolate! The only thing that could potentially be better is a creamy head, but that may mess up the balance Founders has struck with this gem.Aug 01, 2021"
Stout,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.5,"2oz bottle fill date of 3/11/21 into a large snifter.
L: Pours very deep dark brown with a light ruby cast at it's outer edges. It has a dark tan thin head that dissipates to edge foam. No visible carbonation. Some minimal spotty lacing.
S: Coffee, raisins, dark caramel, bourbon, chocolate, toffee.
T: Coffee, sweet chocolate, oak cask, raisins, oats, bitter chocolate, cinnamon, earthy char, burned coffee, charred bread crust.
F: It has a rich, lightly syrupy heavy mouthfeel with ample bitterness and a medium length finish. It does not go wide nor is it too dynamic. For the most part the mouthfeel is centralized.
O: A bittersweet oatmeal stout with profoundly deep columns of flavors. Poured, over time the beer has subtle changes in it's taste which help lead to it's overall deliciousness. A lovely portion of hops go elegantly with the char, coffee and sweet caramel. An incredible example in it's style.Aug 01, 2021"

Look: Two finger tan head, dark color like a cola, lots of carbonation. Lace stays. After half a glass, still retains a thin layer of foam...like an espresso.
Smell: Smell hit before the pour. Chocolate and coffee, like a chocolate covered coffee bean.
Taste: Hits with coffee first then dark chocolate follows. Bitterness as expected but not too bitter.
Feel: Coats the tongue, bubbles give nice tickle.
Overall: Not usually a stout fan but with the chocolate and coffee it is good. Don't drink with food, enjoy alone with sips not gulps.Jul 04, 2021"
Stout,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,"Pours a dark, non-see-through, coffee/espresso with a moderate head that dissapates quickly but lingers on the glass. 

Smell is that of coffee, toffee, and malt.

Taste is rich, full-bodied, and slightly sticky sweet with a bitterness that lingers on the palate for quite a while after each sip. Notes are similar to smell.. with coffee, dark chocolate and toffee at the helm. I'm not picking up on th oatmeal, but it could be because the other flavors are dominant. Alcohol is hidden well at 8.3%, but still noticeable.

Mouth feel is full bodied and syrupy, but not sickeningly so. 

Definitely drinking this one slowly. 

I'm really enjoying this stout. Flavors are all balanced nicely. Because it's so heavy, though, this is one for enjoying on special occasions or as a meal replacement (jk) .
Would definitely recommend this one.Jun 20, 2021"
Stout,4.0,3.75,3.75,4.5,"Bottled 3/11/21. This is the perfect time for a summer spring winter beer.

The description on the back of the bottle pretty much tells it all. It pours dark brown with a small tan head, much like the coffee types it emulates. Smell and taste are almost identical: black coffee and unsweetened chocolate. There is a bit of mild oat sweetness that I get on the nose, but not on the tongue. The chocolate is a bit more pronounced in the taste. There is a particular roasted quality in the aftertaste that I like. It's a cup of joe that makes you feel even better. It's very smooth, which may be attributed to the addition of oatmeal (I'm just reading BA's description of the style at this point). No alcohol heat either.

I enjoy it, even if it is a bit on the bitter side. There just isn't anything that really grabs me.Jun 19, 2021"

L: looks an amazing dark brown with a 1 inch caramel colored head which turns into great lacing almost immediately

S: strong coffee aromas with sweet caramel undertones. This beer doesn't make you search for the smells

T: as advertised, this beer is bitter from the coffee and sweet from the caramel. If you have ever tasted a riesen candy, it tastes identical to that. Somewhat bitter, but the sweetness lingers on your pallet.

F: it has the feel.of an 8.3% beer and I could only have 1 or 2

O: a super tasty beer, but be careful...it'll sneak up on you. Overall, a great stoutMay 31, 2021"
Stout,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.0,"finally time for me to chip in my opinion on this website’s most reviewed beer. I actually got this beer unintentionally, i had bought a bottle of founder’s porter from mchugh’s in kilbarrack, but they were out of stock and sent me this instead, quite the upgrade indeed. this beer is very tasty, pours black as night, tan coloured head with quite good retention, big nose, lot of coffee and chocolate, this beer is super coffee forward, ground coffee beans, espresso, earthy, roasty toasty flavour, burned bread, milk and dark chocolate, nice balance between sweet and bitter flavours, body is creamy and light for a strong stout like this, but still medium to full bodied, some alcohol warming, a very nice stout from a very good brewery.May 26, 2021"

Stout,3.75,3.25,3.25,3.25,"A decent stout that I forgot to log when I drank it. I could get the coffee and chocolate but it still lacked the thickness that I was looking for. At 8.2 ABV it still lacked the punch that I was looking for.Apr 26, 2021"
Stout,4.0,3.75,3.75,4.0,"Definitely has a raisin type smell. The flavor follows suit but you can distinguish the chocolate initially and the coffee on the backend. I like this beer but it’s not as complex as some of the other Founders which some may appreciate but I for one enjoy the mirage of flavors. Not a bad beer, just simple. Maybe if I had tried this before I tried so many of the other breakfast stout variants, I would have a different opinion.Apr 24, 2021"
Stout,4.75,4.75,4.75,5.0,"Previously consumed and often, this review will be perfunctory. It's undeniably one of the best in the world. Out from the 12 ounce bottle into a clear Imperial pint glass, it's a richly deep and dark brown with a modest tan head. The roasted malt, chocolate and oat aroma can't be surpassed by any in this style. It just might be the smoothest and richest brew you can find. The taste overall is complexly bittersweet. There's so much good going on, but the prominent flavors are roasted, not burnt nor overly roasted barley malt, then coffee, then chocolate. If that's not enough for the taste buds to discern, there's some sort of mild spiciness created by the infusion of the major contributors. An amazing mouthfeel for such an ABV, this may be the world's best stout.Apr 10, 2021"
Stout,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.5,"Bottled 1'21, consumed 4'21. Poured into a tulip glass (cuz i like those). Intentionally foamed it a bit & beer responded w/ small/mid-sized head.
Taste: Coffee, no chocolate, no coffee, ... well choco-coffee it is, but medium to full, not at all like a sweet mocha-java. Just the echo of sweetness. Hops are perfect - you couldn't enjoy this with too little and you couldn't experience the choco-coffee with too much. Perfect balance. Zero booziness for a heavy ABV beer.
Look: cross between motor oil & espresso, but not as thick as the stuff left in the coffee pot for 3-4 hours.
Overall: Has to be one of my faves for cool weather beers. Can stand up to a cigar but also good alone. Must be awesome out of the tap; maybe worth a trip to Grand Rapids.Apr 04, 2021"

It is remarkably different than the normal offering or their Märzen. Fresher, crisper, with a smoother and slightly sweet malt backbone, more lively in the nose.

Quite sweet, not much in the way of hops. It has beechwood aging apparently. The rice gives it quite a light crispness that makes it easy to drink fast.

Budweiser,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,"Not as bad as bud light, but still bad. Has that moldy bread taste, not not as strong. Speaking of strong this beer certainly isn't strong in flavor. I like plain wheat beers, heck even some cheap ones, but this is just so weak it has no right calling itself the self proclaimed King of Beers. When Europeans and other foreigners thing of American beers they probably think of this, and I get why they say our beer is weak. They obviously haven't tired a good craft brew, or even at least a Blue Moon or something. Every time I drink ones of these, which only happens when it's offered to me and there are no other options, I remember how bad it is.Jun 07, 2021"

S - Corn flakes, wet hay, and an extremely faint hint at a floral note.
T - Taste follows nose perfectly, with the exception of a slight metallic flavor that I'll blame on the can. On the sweeter side.
F - Fuller in body than Bud Light, which isn't exactly saying much. Refreshing, and well-carbonated.
O - You know how in TV shows and movies when a character walks into a bar, sits down, and orders a beer? I figure this is what they ordered. For what the beer is, it isn't offensive. Overall within the style, it's one of the more terrible beers I've had. It's refreshing and isn't filling. It's a little sweeter than other macros in the style.

Budweiser,2.5,2.0,3.0,2.25,"Straw yellow, thin, see three fizzy yellow water. Aroma is adjunct grain very little hops. Hint of lemon and pear. Cardboard smell.

Budweiser,2.0,1.5,3.0,2.0,"Just imagine the perfect beer: perfect golden color, with an inch of dense, white foam. The smell overpowers your senses like a middle school boy’s locker room.

The mouth feel, akin to the finest Mulberry silk woven by an 89 year old Chinese man who would murder anyone who spoke ill of his work.

Budweiser,4.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I recently purchased one of these that come in an all aluminium bottle, which is pretty interesting and unique for Budweiser and Bud Light. I'm sure other companies have done the same but these are the only big companies that still do it that I know of.

As for the beer, it tastes like a standard American style beer with a little extra zip of intense carbonation at the end. The type of carbonation you'd get from a can of Pepsi. I must say that it tastes the best of all the mass produced American style beers on the market that I've tried so far.

Worth buying one to relax with after a hard days work. I guess that's what they were going for.Apr 11, 2021"
Budweiser,1.5,1.5,1.25,1.5,"One of the high school beers.
Pours clear straw yellow. Small, suspiciously symmetrical, white head. No lacing on the glass.
I can't smell any malt character on this except maybe a very very faint dough note maybe from yeast. 
I can see why this is meant to be served ice cold. The flavour profile is extremely faint and light flavour. There's a very basic light bready malt character and some yeast but I have no idea what they mean by hops because I don't notice any whatsoever. Taste is very very poor. No complexity here and it isn't balanced in terms of sweetness. Way too sweet and nothing that justifies it.
The mouthfeel is extremely light and way way overcarbonanated. Unpleasant.

I never want to come off as bashy on here but wow this one's really bad. Among the 10 or so common beers from high school there were two that had some qualities going for them, being Guinness and Grolsch, but Budweiser is just very watery. There are some beers that are worth $20 per bottle but this is one of those that I can easily say isn't worth $0.30 per bottle.

As a side, been drinking lots of different craft beers for years now and, somehow, I've settled on American lager as my go-to, and not just for pricing. I just never tire of the subtle sweetness and breadiness, and I respect a beer for using a simple recipe.Feb 28, 2021"
Budweiser,2.75,2.5,3.25,4.0,"Very rich tasting beer. Though I'm a staunch hater of Bud Lite this is very different from that. The flavor is not that respectable, but what I do like is the feel.

S - Barley, hops, and yeast all come through front and center.

T - Barley, hops, and yeast are the biggest flavors here along with some bread and straw. For a typical macro lager, this one really does have character and pairs exceptionally well with sushi, dumplings, and miso soup.

M - Tsingtao finishes sharp and clean. It has some bite but is still easy drinking. This could easily be a session beer, especially over a nice long meal.

D - A lot of people might not ""get"" this beer and quickly brush it off as a typical macro. In my humble opinion, that would be a mistake. The only downside to this beer is that it does not sell as often as typical macros and, due to this, is sometimes skunked. In fact, it is nearly impossible to deduce the best by date for this manufacturer, as there is none present on the packaging or bottles themselves. All that I located was a manufacturing date printed on one bottle out of six. Regardless, this beer is meant to be served with food and, though it may sound cliche, it pairs amazingly with sushi.

L: good bit of foam on pour, laced and clung as it receded; the liquid is a brilliantly-polished clear, pale yellow-gold color... head crumbles, breaks apart; thin collar

S: damn, slight skunk... bit of a toasted corn bread note, perhaps even a faint whiff of marshmallow(??)... very little potency overall... the skunk does trail off, while a mild animal cracker note builds

T: was not expecting that flavor... relatively richly-malty base, huh; vaguely doughy... maybe a subtle, grassy bitterness emerges a few sips in, but not much... the malt (sweetness) and bitterness are both rather low, and seemingly in balance; relatively dry, mute aftertaste, though the bitterness creeps up as it goes

F: delicate, silky bounce to its body; stealth carbonation... perhaps the most 'full'-bodied light lager I've ever tried

O: I must say, for a 'light lager', this was quite enjoyable... this may be only my second (at most third) time having this; first time by itself w/o food... seems like it would stand out of the way of most foods, but its dull sizzle may not lift much fat...

Flavor: Flavor follows the nose. Corn with a hint of lemon. Less skunk on flavor. No hop bitterness. Finishes a little sweet. (3.50)

Feel: Lighter-bodied, crisp, and clean. Almost no carbonation and a little flat. No detectable alcohol (3.25)

Overall: A pretty standard pale European lager. It is probably light-struck in the green bottle. No idea the date on this one. It's not too skunky at least. It's light, clean, and has good malt flavors. I'll have to compare it to the Tiger... (Final Rating: 3.40)Aug 11, 2019"

Mouthfeel: Light but full, high carbonation, and quite clean and crisp throughout
Overall: Solid and a pleasant surprise here. Having never had this beer and given it was sitting at room temp, I wasn’t expecting much but this has good flavor, doesn’t taste like it’s heavy on adjuncts, and is quite refreshing. I’m curious if they use rice in this because as it warmed, some of the grains and that herbaceous note started reminding me more of steeped rice or the smell of any excess rice water post-cooking.

A light, easy drinking pale lager.Oct 15, 2019"
Singha,5.0,4.25,4.5,3.75,"My inaugural trip to Thailand as a new Eagle Scout and subsequent trips saw us actually rarely drinking other beers, other than Chang, and Kingfisher (India) as it's fantastic, not too alcoholic, and you can get your bottles served capped to prevent anybody from adding anything that might put you into a coma way earlier than you had anticipated. All the yuppies that did exchange trips can't go out without exclaiming ""LOOK! That's the Beer I Drank When I was in Butt Fuck Bunglapoor Bangladesh!'. I keep it low and i usually don't have my distributor order it, but a local Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh will sell to me in six-packs with takeout or more if I can convince them I'm not an LCB agent. Great beer, comparable to Miller HIgh Life but with the climate and the atmosphere even in US Thai Food spots makes it imperative that you keep it as cool as possible as long as possible. It loses more character than any other beer I've had warm for sure.Sep 19, 2019"

L: polished-clear, gold liquid; crackly pad of off-white suds... foam collapses before you know it, standard collar; almost no lace

S: plain donut; soft white grape (or sweet apple cider) note; faint bit of spicy booze?... lightly-toasted granola; plump malts it would appear, perhaps with the esters, giving a malt liquor flavor?...

T: yeah, a bit malt liquor-ish - thick white, doughy-bready malt, slipping off slowly in the finish; apple cider note in the background for sure... lots of malt, but little yeast aromatics; rather dull, grassy bitterness, not enough to do its job

F: its body seems want to sluggishly fan out, but it does have a surprising taper on the edges, while the lively carbonation no doubt helps lift it away... still, it has a bit more slick chub to its body than is generally found in other examples of the style

O: way more malty than anticipated and, as far as Euro pales go, on the maltier end of the spectrum... this is much more akin to a Colt 45 perhaps... not bad, not good, but I almost wish I'd been warned...

Compared w/ Sapporo: More of a white rice, bitter sake component, Less body and yeast.

Overall: A little sweeter and malt forward, yet its light and fairly clean. I get more of an American malt profile here. Pretty much corn malt and generic. Nice biscuit malt flavors I suppose. Pretty low to average for a Euro pale. (Final Rating: 3.59)Aug 18, 2019"

Cafri,2.0,1.5,2.0,2.0,"This is what passes for designer beer here in Korea, with a white label and clear bottle, it is still produced by macrobrewer OB as their offering for Korean girls watching their waists.

The color is a pale yellow reminiscent of Corona although pouring does produce a surprisingly decent head.

Cafri is actually rare among macrobrews in that it has even less taste than smell, the latter being grainy and slightly noxious..smells like rice with an almost citrus flavor hiding in the back, but that could be my imagination. 

Texture is very watery and the flavor, minute as it is, passes in an instant, like Kaiser Soze (poof..he's gone)

The overwhelming feature of mouthfeel is excessive carbonation..like drinking beer flavored seltzer.

Pilsner Urquell,3.75,4.0,3.75,3.75,"The archetypal Czech pilsner. There are better out there I'm sure, but this is the yardstick. And it's enjoyable. The colour is straight up apple juice. Head is good at first, big loose bubbles, but dissipates to nothing within minutes, leaving little to no lacing. Big biscuit and grainy malt on the nose, then a distinct but gentle hops character. The taste starts very balanced and mild, a very subtle maltiness with a strong hop undercurrent, but the hops build and build towards a bright, spicy, floral, crisp finish. I'm struck by the thought that this would go extremely well with pizza or pasta, cutting through the creaminess of the sauce with its sharp and crisp feel nicely. My personal preference is stronger malt character and subtler hops, but I understand this is the style, and that being said this type of hops is much more pleasant to me than fruity American hops. Overall, if what defines the difference between the German Pils style and the Czech Pilsner style is the emphasis on malt vs hops, then I do prefer the smoother and maltier German style.Sep 05, 2021"

The classic PILS, sweet malt and yeast aromas.

On the nose, Pilsner Urquell is everything you want in a good pilsner's aroma. There are the expected aromas of soda cracker, fresh bread, and freshly malted pale grains. Somehow though they have a balance that goes beyond what's achieved by lesser examples of the style. Center brings me raw honey, which seems to pull other aromas together nicely.

On the tongue, Pilsner Urquell is smooth and pleasantly low in carbonation. Flavors start off with the expected bready, malty, soda cracker notes of pale malt. Smooth mouthfeel combined with flavors of raw honey make for a very refreshing profile. Pilsner Urquell finishes off with a hit of peppery, European hops giving just a little bitterness before fading away.

This is one of those classic beers that I'm not sure how I haven't had it yet.I know it's a pretty widely available/not highly sought-after import, but I hardly ever see it at my local store. When I finally did see it elsewhere, I knew I had to grab a few cans and see what it's all about

Pours a crystal clear gold with 3 finger of pillowy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

While I haven't tried all that many Czech pilsners, the nose still seems awfully sweet for the style, though that should be taken as a compliment rather than a complaint. I'm picking up on aromas of buttery honey, soft bready malt, sweet grain, floral hops, and a hint of earthy pepper

The sweetness is not completely thrown out the window taste-wise, but it definitely took me by surprise based on my anticipation from the aroma. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting crisp bready malt, floral hops, lemon, and light orange. The swallow brings notes of sweet honey, doughy malt, floral hops, and white pepper

A light body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in an impossibly smooth and airy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a decent amount of sweetness

Pilsner Urquell,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"6.9oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $2.49. Best By 7/5/2021.

Look: Nice deep golden color. Very clear. A little bit of fine floaties after pouring the bottom of the can. Head did not stick around very long. Lots of little bubbles rising up in the glass. Would be nice if there was better head retention for this style.

Smell: Has a bit of a skunkiness to it, which could actually work so let's not knock it yet. Has a bit of mustiness too. Predominant flavors of lemon and floral notes, also mildly peppery. Slight bready / perfumy aroma also along with some yeastiness.

Taste: It's surprisingly malty on the taste. Very crackery with a generic, flat Noble hop bitterness that lingers on the palate. Lots of skunkiness on the palate, not so pleasant. Surprising given that this seems like a fresh beer and the fact that it's canned should reduce the light-struck effect. The hops just don't have that crisp refreshingness that I was hoping for. That being said, the bitterness accumulates over time and builds on the finish as you drink more of it. This is not what I was expecting from a classic Czech pilsner. This beer comes off way too sweet and really needs some brightness to make it more drinkable in my opinion. It's far from undrinkable, you can easily put it down, but it's just not very enjoyable.

Feel: Decent level of carbonation and the mouthfeel is light to medium. This beer may benefit from a touch more carbonation.

Overall: A little disappointing. It's arguably a step up from American macro beer, but that's not saying much. This beer is drinkable when it's cold, but I would say don't even try to drink this if it's not cold as it would be completely undrinkable.Feb 09, 2021"

The first time I tasted Carlsberg was in Stockholm 9 years ago - it was $11 a glass in a cafe! Alcohol is heavily taxed in Sweden (they had prohibition longer than the US), especially when served in a restaurant. I found that it was considerably cheaper in their supermarkets. Carlsberg is based in Denmark, but has plants in Sweden - probably the most popular lager there. Living in central NH, I don't see exotic beers that often, but suddenly a grocery chain here starting carrying Carlsberg (canned in Denmark) at an attractive price (Market Basket - $12 for 12 0.5 liter cans).

Carlsberg,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"I would have to say for an established European beer brand it's ok. Definitely a beer i would only drink ice cold; not a fan of this beer when it's warm. Look, smell, taste and feel are average. A bit of hoppy after taste as well.Aug 22, 2020"
Carlsberg,2.5,1.75,2.75,1.5,"Not good. Mediocre taste, no body, no aroma's. Propably not the best beer in the world. Marketing is everything it seems, but a great lager it is not.Aug 13, 2020"
Carlsberg,4.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,"Pours a pale golden color with a bigger, fone pored, stable head.

Smells of sweet caramel, rustic wheat and lighter copper.

Has a very light, yet well balanced mouthfeel with an effervescent carbonation, which becomes apparent after the swallow.

Tastes of hay, rock sugar infused bread dough and caramel. This gets toned down by a vivid, slightly metallic carbonation, bringing up a faint, short glimpse of matured hops to the palate. Finishes one-dimensional sweet with caramel and lighter wheat dominating the flavors, balanced by the conspicuous carbonation.

Another macro lager which manages to satisfy pretty much any person in need of an easy drinking, thirst quenching beer, without looking for too much character at the same time.Jul 28, 2020"
Carlsberg,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,"This was my college drink of choice in 12 packs back in the late 90's, when it was brewed and bottled (in brown bottles) by Labatt's. For that reason, I've always had an affection for the brand, though today I'd probably turn my nose up at the swill that was being passed off as ""Carlsberg"" back then. (It was likely just Blue with a different label). 

Poured from a 500ml can into a glass mug. 2 fingers of head that dissolve rather quickly, but as with the light version of this, scattered lacing remains on the glass as I drink it. Minimal carbonation. Tastes of slight bread and malt with just a touch of skunk. There's a flavourful punch here that other mass produced pilseners lack, but the finish is refreshing and satisfying. I love that this remains readily available in my area, and is priced reasonably. It's my favourite after-work refresher, and also works quite well as first beer to whet the palate, before I dive into more full-bodied ales and heartier German lagers.Jun 28, 2020"
Carlsberg,4.0,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Appearance: Pours a deep, clear orange color with a spotty white head. SRM of 9-10. (4.00)

Aroma: Aromas of earthy, wet bread. A touch of rubber and lemon flower. Dry on the finish. (3.75)

Flavor: Flavor is with more wet, earthy bread with only a hint of rubber. A touch of flower and rubber on the finish. Finishes rather clean and dry. (3.75)

Feel: Medium-bodied for the style with moderate carbonation. A slight rubbery or perfume astringency on the finish. Dry. (3.75)

Compared to Stella Artois 6/14/20: Pours a slightly darker color. Stronger earthy bread flavors. Less lemonflower/citrus. Slightly heavier bodied. Very similar beers.

Overall: A pretty good European Pale Lager. Better than I expected and lands somewhere around average. Get it fresh so that it isn't oxidized and skunked by the time you drink it. Not sure why they still put these beers in green bottles just asking for oxidation. Fortunately this one wasn't oxidized. (Final Rating: 3.77)Jun 14, 2020"
Carlsberg,3.0,2.75,3.25,3.75,"I tried this beer once several years ago when I was in Germany for two weeks - I believe it was somewhere in Dresden.a Today at a liquor store in Oklahoma City is the first time I have seen it in Oklahoma, and I didn’t remember much about it, so I got the six pack of 12 oz bottles. 

Pours a completely transparent gold with a thin white head. Good retention considering how thin it is. Not much lacing. 

Aroma is a bit skunky, with strong corn, as well as some honey, floral hops, and maybe apple?

Taste follows the nose, but it is on the bland side for a Pilsner. Finish is quick and semi-dry, but with a bit of a skunky hit before it disappears.

Feel is the nicest part. Light to medium bodied and strong carbonation. Smooth.

Overall - best beer in the world? No. Best Danish Pilsner I have ever had? Yes. I read a review below that said not to judge it based on bottles sent here to the US, so I will make sure to give it a go on tap next time I am in Europe. I can see this being much better over there.Jun 14, 2020"
Carlsberg,4.0,3.0,3.25,3.75,"Crystal clear gold; with a white head. Pretty good retention. Some lacing.

Smells like green apple, honey, corn, and bell pepper.

Tastes like artificial green apple skin, tart, very green apple-forward--followed by honey, flaked corn, white bread, green pepper flesh and some dried grass. Lightly sweet, finishes mostly clean and crisp.

Medium-light feel, well carbonated, slightly oily with sweetness.

Overall? Ehhh...not terrible. I wanted to like it more. It's just too much jarringly apple-forward and sweet for me to truly enjoy, even from the can to avoid skunk. I'd drink it in a pinch, but otherwise not recommend it.Jun 09, 2020"
Carlsberg,3.25,2.75,3.0,3.0,"This is an okay Pale Lager, nothing really special about it other than it is from Denmark. It is a pretty light tasting ale, which is a good thing I believe. It is something that is fairly refreshing when the weather is hot like it is here today. I would drink it again, but I would not go out of my way to find it.May 02, 2020"
Carlsberg,3.0,3.0,3.25,3.25,"The Carlsberg I tried came from two stores, and neither were brewed in Denmark. The first was brewed in Estonia, and the second by ""Kronenbourg Supply Company"" in France. Obviously they are farming this out to the cheaper/cheapest producers. Quality control may be an issue, as the Estonian version tasted better than the French. These days with major name macro brew there is no guarantee of any kind of authenticity I suppose, just a brand and some liquid inside the can. The beer (or ""brand"" I should say) is hard to judge as a result, but combining my impressions of the two beers from two different countries, it is an average if not slightly above average Euro lager. Basic beer taste, slightly skunky and bitter, better than Heineken but in the pale/pilsner lager category not quite as good as Polish Zywiec or German Radeburger, which are both brewed where they originated and in the same price range. But hey, Carlsberg is not to be avoided for $1.50 per 16oz serving. It is worth what you pay for it.Feb 15, 2020"
Carlsberg,4.5,3.0,3.25,3.0,"Not bad but a bit bland. When it is on sale in 160z cans it is a good deal, otherwise there are better brands. Light color without much flavor or aroma.Feb 14, 2020"
Carlsberg,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.5,"Wasn't that impressed with this one. Tastes rather basic. Pours a golden color, nothing special. Smells rather funky, and old. Tastes pretty malty with a slight banana flavor. Typical European beer flavors. Definitely not buying it again.Nov 30, 2019"

S: fresh-baked baguette, apple (cidery) spice; rather potent, lovely fragrances

T: underlying blandness; bread crust grain angle to its solid, smooth malt base... barely any bitterness, maybe just enough to register... the usual spicy bubblegum highlight when swilled from the can isn't as present in glass... mild bready aftertaste... flavors seem dulled in this one

F: soft carbonation; delicate nectary plush texture, subtle bouncy chew to its body... smooth flow, almost as if unfiltered; easily gulpable

O: interesting departure from how I normally drink this - shocking cold, from a 500ml(?) can... did buy another one of these big'uns a couple months back, but hadn't realized I never reviewed the beer... won't be my last (1407)Jul 19, 2019"
Carlsberg,3.5,3.25,3.5,4.0,"2 pack of 16oz cans picked up for 12 dollars at Total Wine in Ballard, Washington. BBD on the cans is 8/9/19.

Look- Medium straw color, small off-white head with little lacing as it goes.

Smell- Bread and grains with a little floral hop in the mix.

Taste- Bread, grains, a little malty with a slightly fruity thing in tail.

Feel- Really light, not bitter at all, and doesn't seem to start get filling at all after a couple of cans.

O- I don't understand the low rating. This is much better than most American AAL and at this price it's considerably cheaper. Total party/get together/camping/bon fire beer.

Taste: Malt forward, slight bitterness, some sweetness on the back end. A little more complex than a typical macrobrew.
Feel: A tongue tingler, mouthfeel pretty typical of lager, dry finish. The flavor lingered after finishing the glass,
Overall: A middle of the road beer. Would I get it again? Probably, if the mood struck and I was doing a Japanese-themed meal.

Kirin Ichiban,3.75,2.75,3.0,3.0,"Meh American Lager!!! Pours a nice clear gold color with a big fizzy white head that fades fast. Thin bands of lacing on the glass, head retention is less than average. Taste and aroma is the ""rice and corn"" background with a little maltiness and some mild grassy hops. There is bit of a metallic taste here too....Not great. Mouthfeel feaures a lot of carbonation and an overall weak, watery ""feel"". A lawnmower beer at best.Sep 26, 2021"

Nothing special really.Aug 20, 2021"
Kirin Ichiban,3.75,4.0,4.0,4.25,"Pours a deep golden color with a tin topping of a white head. Nice lazy carbonation bubbles abound. Head is dissipating into the beer.

Smell is like a clan lager. Big punch of like a bready smell. There is a bread that is made with lots of eggs and I cannot think of the name. This smells like that soft pillowy bread.

Very nice hit of that 100% as advertised malt right up front. The malt does taste seems to have just a faint hint of sweetness. That punch of malt up front leads one to think that this may be a heavier full flavored punch. Yet the sneaky part is halfway across the tongue this flavor profile fades to a nice clean lager.

Mouth feel does seem a bit more toward medium but can be deceiving due to the fairly crisp finish.

The rating on this beer is to low. I am sorry but this is sitting at a 64! No this beer deserves better than that. I will say if you have not tried this beer get you some. If you like a nice clean easy drinking lager this one works. And at 5% ABV a person can still afford to have a few. Cheers! And hats off to the brewers of this beer!Jul 17, 2021"
Kirin Ichiban,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.0,"Back in days, I had the Kirin ichiban that was made in Japan for several times, and I would say it’s totally different thing when compared with that made in North America. The Japan version has a very distinct fruity taste, and I don’t know why, it’s not like the 1664 which use orange peal as ingredient, but still, fruity.Jul 10, 2021"
Kirin Ichiban,3.25,2.5,2.5,2.0,"This one pours a clear golden straw yellow, with a small head, and lots of lcaing.

This smells metallic and skunky, with a grainy sweetness and some corn.

This is not very good - I was curious because I had never tried it, but I guess perhaps there was a reason for that. It's got that vegetal bitterness a lot of these cheap lagers have, with no real hop character. It's not inoffensive enough to be even worth it.

This is light bodied, with a harsh finish - it's not all that drinkable.

I can't really recommend this one. It probably wouldn't pair well with food, either.Jun 15, 2021"

Kirin Ichiban,3.5,2.75,2.75,4.0,"Clear, clean beer with a little apple cider tang to its moderately sweet malt side. Balances with bitterness pretty well, fairly neutral to maybe slightly dirty to grassy. There’s not much to the nose.Apr 18, 2021"
Kirin Ichiban,4.0,2.75,2.75,2.75,"Kirin Ichiban is a crystal clear, pale amber the lager. Pinpoint CO2 rises through the glass, supporting a cloudy bone white head. The head has decent retention, leaving nice lace as it recedes.
Malt dominates the nose in the form of white bread and unsalted crackers. Bready malts lead to a center that has an interesting smooth, almost neutral aroma. The first descriptor that popped into my mind was “Papery,” but somehow that doesn’t seem right. Rather, that strange, neutral aroma smells like rice. If you can imagine dried, white rice sitting in the bag waiting for you to cook it. That sort of smell. Rice aroma dominates from here on, before fading into an abrupt finish.
On the tongue, Kirin Ichiban is smooth and dry; almost too dry, really. That dryness takes over and dominates the flavor and mouthfeel in a way that almost immediately detracts from my enjoyment of the beer. This is too bad, because at first Kirin Ichiban is smooth, and almost rounded in nature. There’s a hint of sweetness up front, as well. But then that dryness comes in, coating the tongue, and dominating the rest of the drinking experience.
This Asian lager has the potential to be a decent, maybe even enjoyable lager. Unfortunately the two things I didn’t like about the beer are such noticeable flaws, it prevents me from really enjoying what I’m drinking. I certainly didn’t care for the aromas of rice and the dryness on the tongue made it hard for me to feel refreshed after each sip.Apr 01, 2021"

It looks like a bad tasting beer, but tastes pretty bready and nice carbonation. I'd recommend drinking it from the can. Maybe in a glass, the dehydrated piss color and lack of aeration from the can opening makes it tastes slightly worse. Could see myself having 5 of these in Tokyo or at a backyard party.Jun 17, 2020"

Kirin Ichiban,3.75,3.0,3.25,3.5,"Poured from a can into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a clear golden amber color with a one finger head of white foam. The head has a decent level of retention, slowly fading to leave a moderate sum of lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is light overall with some smells of a light grain and caramel smell. Along with these aromas comes a little bit of a herbal and earthy smell as a touch of hay.
Taste – The taste begins with a slightly grainy and caramel sweetened taste with a touch of a grassy taste. As the taste advances the sweeter flavors grow stronger all while the grainy drops and becomes more doughy and bready in nature. All the while, the grassy tastes fade and are replaced by a touch of hay, leaving one with a rather light and slightly malty taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is lighter and more crisp, with a carbonation level that is rather high. For the lighter tastes and the style of the brew the feel is great and makes for a very easy sipping and refreshing brew overall.
Overall – An easy drinking brew overall. Nothing spectacular, but rather easy going.Jun 04, 2020"

Pours a clear yellow, with plenty of foam in the 14 oz shaker. Taste is very smooth and grainy, cream of wheat, or more likely Cream of Rice. I would not bet that hops are involved but it's got a decent ""beery"" aoma. Less prickly than a lot of other light lagers. It's actually quite drinkable, provided the thirst is available.

Just a ""Eh..."" beer for me.May 25, 2021"

-Bitter lemon-citric smell. And orange.
-Citric and coffe at the same time. Bitter orange taste. It is not bad but I think it is strange. 
-Pinching aftertaste. Acid feel. Not too much watery but watery.

Blue Moon Belgian White,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.25,"Wheat beers are one of my top light colored styles, although I have more experience in the German world. Poured from a tall can a bright copper color. Fast and fizzy carbonation with a regular white head. a bit of a fog throughout due to the yeasts. Earthy grass, orange peel, and coriander on the nose, all as advertised. A definite bready yeast aroma lightened by the sweetness of fruit. Not super dynamic, to the style. A taste of bread crust and orange. There are floral hints as well. High carbonation and on the thin side. Slightly oily.
Overall this beer is an easy sipper with not much to attach to. It is a casual conversational beverage, when there are other matters to discuss other than beer itself. It has a one or two flavor dimensions, but is primarily a yeasty beer, as to be expected. Enjoyable, but I will not be picking this up again any time soon, there is else to explore.Feb 25, 2021"
Blue Moon Belgian White,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.5,"I like wheat beers, especially on hot days. So when I saw a 6 pack on special it was an easy pick. Unfortunately I wasn't wearing my glasses and missed the part about it being flavoured with oranges and coriander.

Personally, I think anything with ingredients other than malted grains, hops, yeast and water should never be allowed to be called beer. So this mistake is on me.

Amazingly, for something labelled as a 'Wheat Ale' it doesn't hold a head. The mouthfeel is thin and oily. My guess would be the wheat proportion is notional. Nor does the addition of coriander entitle the brewers to call this a 'Belgian Style' ale.

Taste and smell? Oranges and coriander. 

Nothing short of an abomination. It only gets points from me because I acknowledge that I erred in picking it up, and for anyone who actually wants a flavoured beer (shame on you) this would do what it says on the label.

For anyone else: wear your glasses when you buy beer.Jan 23, 2021"

Smell: Light orange smell, very wheat forward and light booze aroma.
Taste: Very strong orange and spice flavor; it smells like a beer but doesn't really taste like a beer necessarily. It has a pleasant bitter to sweet balance, but it's very fruity and spicy. The aftertaste became more broad in terms of fruit and reminds me a lot of Fruit Loops...

Blue Moon Belgian White,3.5,2.75,3.25,2.0,"Look: Opaque, cloudy, orange yellow with a two finger satin white head. No lacing, low head retention.

Aroma: The coriander and orange peel come through in a soapy, oily way. Faintest notion of caramel malt.

Taste: Spices upfront, predominantly coriander and orange rind. Vaguely tangy. A caramel malt sweetness creeps in mid palate with notes of floral, banana like yeast rounding out the finish. The taste is artificial and ingenuine - there's too much emphasis on the spice.

Feel: Body is heavy and detracts from the flavor. Low carbonation. Not sessionable if you ask me - this is a ""one and done"" type of beer.

Overall: The mouthfeel is this beers achilles heel. I find the spices they use abrasive and somewhat cloying also. My biggest complaint is that it's simply too heavily spiced and syrupy.Sep 24, 2020"

Blue Moon Belgian White,3.25,3.75,3.25,3.5,"2oz bottle abandoned at the airport but undamaged and seemingly unspoilt. Seemed silly to throw it away. Why not sample it for science instead? According to the stamp on the neck of the bottle, this is best by January 11, 2021.

Poured into a snifter, this was an opaque, dark tangerine color, with a beige head that noisily vaporized itself from view in seconds. It sounded like rice crispies in milk. Brief appearance of spotty lace.

Nose isn't bad for the style. Coriander, orange peel, earthy wheat. 

Taste similar to the smell, but less sharp, more unfocused, than most Belgian wits. I'm guessing it's been dumbed down in this regard for mass appeal. 

Midway between light and medium in the body. Mouthfeel isn't unacceptable, but could stand to be a little lighter.

Meh. A mass consumption version of a Belgian with her, which I expected going in. Could stand to be more distinctive, but all those women I see walking into Bennidito's, expecting it to be on tap because they had it there a few years ago and bitching about that no longer being the case, would probably not be so into it if it was closer to a proper wit.Sep 12, 2020"

Look - Slight haze, soft soapy head. Head lingers a bit, decent retention. Carbonation visibly rising steadily in glass. Suspended particles settling towards the bottom of the glass (yeast or citrus fruit?)

Smell - Perfume. Not entirely pleasant.

Taste/Mouthfeel - Estery with banana. Lemony citrus. Slight sharpness towards the end. Finishes somewhat dry. Rather soft feeling on the palette. 

Overall - Not terrible, and given the age it's managed to keep some freshness to it, although I feel it may have had an impact on the aroma possibly. It's a good budget witbier for the price.Jul 22, 2020"

The initial smell had a distinct odor of ham in it, which died down after a moment. Other than that it has a fresh aroma of lemon and apricot.

The taste follows the smell; a fresh taste of lemon, apricot, wheat and slight spiciness. Mouthfeel is light bodied, medium carbonated and slightly sour. The aftertaste is dry.

There was only a touch of ""Green bottle"" skunk, and the base grains were nice, although the yeast and spices were subdued.

Similar on the tongue, with the yeast and spices being much brighter. 

The body was the anticipated light, smooth, and had a surprisingly dry-ish finish.

Appearance: medium golden hue with plenty of haze and a finger of compact foam atop. It looks quite good, actually.

Smell: wheaty and floral aroma with hints of orange and bergamot. It's quite a bit better than I was expecting, to be honest.

Taste: floral and coriander-ey, with a bit of a sweet malt character. There's definitely a good wheat flavor in there, but the spicing is a bit un-subtle; the overall effect is a little soapy. That said, I kind of like it.

This is also the first beer that I felt I loved. It's so good. Now all of that aside. I'll review the draft version that I got a growler full of. Poured into a 16oz weizen glass.

L: I love the look of this beer. It's a witbier so unsurprisingly, it's a bright golden shade. Mix in a slight haziness that comes from the wheat and a dense head and you have a picturesque beer.

S: This is probably the weakest aspect of the beer to me. The beer smells good. It's a delicate wheat smell but it's masked by a very perfume-y spicy coriander/ orange peel.

T: Here is the best part. It's very subtle. The flavor is like the aroma, some light wheaty notes on the front. As you let it set for a second you pick up a little bit of breadiness that fades to an orange peel and slight herb taste. And as quickly as the flavor is there, it's gone. No hoppiness, no bitterness.

F: I love the mouth feel on this beer. The carbonation was very fine. It's so smooth and light on the mouth that this would be an easy beer to chug. I sure as hell didn't after spending nearly 30 on a growler of it but it does make me curious how quickly I could drink 100 oz of this. 

O: I drank a growler of this in one night easily because it's so easy to drink. There's no accumulation of flavors as you drink more and more. The last of the growler tasted like the first sip and I love that aspect. I, of course, highly recommend this beer to anyone that is looking for an easy drink in literally any weather.Aug 06, 2019"

Great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, spices, pale/wheat malts, and light earthy hop flavors; with a solid malt/bitter/spiciness balance, and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitter/spiciness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is fantastic. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5%.

Kronenbourg 1664 Blanc,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a heavily hazed golden color with a one finger head of billowy white foam. The head fades slowly over time to leave a tons of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is strongest of a coriander and clove smell mixed with other aromas of a bit of bread and yeast. There is a little bit of grass as well as a hint of hay, creating a decent smell overall.
Taste – The taste begins with flavors of a bready nature that has some other tastes of the spice detected in the nose. Along with the coriander and clove spice is also some flavors of nutmeg and a good showing of yeast. These tastes take the taste to the end, where they leave one with a moderately bready and spiced Belgium white taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is on the average to slightly chewier side with a carbonation level that is rather moderate. For the bready and yeasty taste, and the decent showing of spice, the feel is pretty good and makes for a nice media for all the tastes to be appreciated by the tongue.
Overall – While nothing out of this world, a decent Belgium white overall. Easy to drink, rather flavorful, and quite smooth.Oct 28, 2018"

S: popped off crown - skunked!... once poured in glass, the skunk persists, but rather lovely, potent, perfumy tones of the citrus and subtle coriander push to the fore... the skunk may linger in the background, but overall the aromas are inviting

T: interesting taste at first... rather wheaty like a puff pastry and colored in flowery tones... by the second sip it's definitely growing on me... dry, lemon-zesty aftertaste, coriander gradually builds... the skunk essence does vapor forth onto the palate while going in for a sip, lingers a little in the aftertaste, but the full flavor of its core elements sound loud enough to drown it out - if you'd had Heineken enough over the years, this little defect shouldn't distract much, but it'd of course be preferable without and I'm sure make a noticeable difference

F: foamy and fluffy, fleecy soft; subtle powdery touch, delicate little spicy tickle at the back of the palate... not much in need of adjustment - easily gulpable

It's been a loooong time since I've had one of these, but I'm surprised to find that this is actually a little skunky, making it somewhat reminiscent of a Heine. There's also a lightly bready, corny quality within the medium body's firm froth, which finishes semi-dry. 

I'm not sure how or why beer like this ever gained such wide appeal, aside from being the only option for humans for entire generations, but that must have created a lingering nostalgia for skatolic qualities within us. Poor suckers, we are.Aug 17, 2021"
Stella Artois,3.5,3.0,2.0,3.5,"It was the skunk in the aroma and taste which was by far the most dominant factor that made this unenjoyable.

Stella Artois,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.75,"The big thing about this beer is the overall dull, malty taste. I didn't get much hop presence. It is close to what I would consider a ""skunked"" beer.

The head builds quickly then recedes to a thin ring and single layer of bubbles. Slight lacing. The aroma is faint with barley malt and yeast. The taste is also subdued with pils type malt sweetness up front and a slightly metallic, slightly watery, skunk and floral hop finish. That all probably sounds bad, but it's not. It all mostly works. The mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and a dry finish. Cleanly lagered. Overall, good. I have to say this is better cold, so if you go for the 19.2, you need to be quick about it. This can was brewed in Belgium BTW, not sure how much longer that will be the case.Feb 25, 2021"

Mouthfeel is crisp up front with maltiness throughout.

Beck's,3.0,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Beck's has always been one of my favourite European macro lagers. OK, sure, it has always been relatively cheap in Australia, but I've never found anything wrong with it, and it always goes down smooth and easy for me. 

Look: Classic pale golden straw colour. Typical German/European lager. Thick bubbly white head. Looks refreshing. Looks standard. Better head retention than some lagers I've reviewed. 

Smell: Grassy hops with a hint of citrus - lemon peel. , sweet pale malt, smells clean, smells refreshing. 

Taste: Taste follows through the nose, sweet pale malts, hints of lemon peel and grassiness from the hops. Slightly bitter makes it quite refreshing, slight bit of a metallic note, but given this has spent however many months sitting in a can since it was brewed, and shipped half way around the world it's to be expected. 

Feel: Not overly carbonated, smooth, clean and very refreshing. 

Overall: I like Becks. Yes, it's a mass produce lager, but the European mass produced lagers are a world ahead generally than what most American and Australian mass produced lagers are. It's refreshing, has good flavour, and has everything I want generally in a lager. Great lawnmower beer, can have plenty of these after a hard days work.Sep 06, 2021"

Beck's,2.75,3.5,3.5,4.0,"This is not the swill haters portray, not even close. It’s merely an alteration of what once was. A Becks Light in 1976 would have tasted similar. Less booze than it once had and the distinctive skunky bite is still there but tempered. Becks is now made in USA by AB, and in my opinion now tastes a lot like a 1976 Budweiser, no accident I’m sure. Craft beer is great but for warm weather pounding it can get a bit heavy. This stuff is cheap, clean, crisp and tasty. Please drink responsibly.May 15, 2021"
Beck's,3.0,1.75,1.75,2.5,"12 oz bottle. No pour.

The aroma is skunky and grainy. Not very pleasant.

The flavor is very sweet, like shockingly so. No hops detected for any semblance of balance. Just sweet, grainy malts. Not ""cloying"", but definitely hard to get down. It's almost a bit medicinal, like cough syrup. But this doesn't get you high.

The feel is...like a typical light lager: crisp, yet watery. Drinkable, if not for the flavor.

Overall, not a good beer at all. Drank a couple of these at a friend's (less than 10 people, calm down). Only beer he had and it was free so no complaining. But definitely not something I'd ever pick up again if given the choice.Jan 27, 2021"
Beck's,2.25,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Adding a review to my scoring. Like another, I drank Beck's in the 70s and early 80s when, as I remember, it had some taste. Although it was not my favorite German at the time, it was better than Natty Boh. Fast forward to today . . . I guess this is made in a Bud plant in St. Louis. It is is very much lifeless . . . like Corona except nobody puts a lime in a Beck's. BTW, this was part of a beer club that my son gave me for Christmas. The club is supposed to give me hard to find German beers. The last two shipments had Beck's. Ugh. 

The beer is a very pale straw. I cannot pick up a nose. I guess this is a plus as it does not have a foul odor. There is a faint taste of grain and malt. No hops. Light carbonation and body. Feels like seltzer. I hope I do not get this in the next hard to find German beer shipment. ;)Jan 24, 2021"

Beck's,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,"I used to really like Becks; I used to buy two ice cold bottles at my off-licence, walking home from the station after work, on a hot day and by jimeny, they tasted GREAT!
Since then; I bought two bottles from a local petrol station, yesterday; bottles looked similar to the old style, but on opening, the taste was nothing like ten years ago, I examine the label, now owned by Anheur Busch, oh no!
Then, the kicker, while being passed off as the original, this is , in fact , a 4% imposter, not the original 5%; the taste is vastly inferior and in fact I had to force myself to drink the second, after a prolonged struggle to down the first; why do these companies ruthlessly acquire breweries with a good name, only to reduce them to a phantom of their former quality.

Beck's,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,"Writing from the UK:

Beck's lager in the UK supermarkets is no longer Beck's 5% ABV original recipe lager brewed in Bremen. It should not be labelled as Becks.

The original 140 year old recipe lager isn't used and exported to supermarkets here anymore since the original brewers were bought out by the giant ""drinks manufacturer"" AB InBev. They hark on that they still abide by The German Purity Law, but that's not the only reason Becks USED to be a good lager:

Becks is a classic Premium German lager steeped in history and brewed by possibly the greatest lager brewing country in the world for around 130 years. A clean, not full-bodied lager but with a nicely noticeable aftertaste of hops and great tasting barley, finished off with a 5% ABV to get the palette fresh again for the next cool gulp. A very subtle, yet complex aftertaste if served at just the right temperature, it would shine through with all the best qualities and poise of a classic German lager. 
The original brew from Bremen was once a hard-to-beat lager to sup from an ice cold bottle on a hot day, or enjoy as a palette cleanser with a good curry. For the same kind of age -old classic lager, only Lowenbrau original blue label refreshes in the same way as original Becks did.

Unfortunately, to my knowledge the original drink is no longer available in UK outlets, and the classic German legend has disappeared from the shelves, replaced by a 4 or 4.8% ABV pretend version of the brew. Since AB InBev acquired Becks, they have taken the brewing outside of it's homeland and messed about with the classic recipe endlessly by lowering the ABV to 4.8%, introduced Beck Vier (4%), and now seem to be labelling 4% Becks as just simply Becks in the UK. All in the cause to save Duty Tax and save more money for themselves and/or appease the ever-greedy supermarkets. 

Becks (4%) on sale now is not original Becks, although it pretends to be (Becks Vier 4% seems to be phasing out). 

Becks 4% (and 4.8%) has completely lost it's original taste, probably due to not using the same ingredients sourced by the original brewery in Germany, and not having the skills, equipment, nor centuries of knowledge in lager brewing. We all know the 4 ingredients, and changing only 1 of these by source only can change the taste of a delicately balanced lager like this. Changing the source of all 4 ingredients which has probably happened in the US, and altering the brewing process has just wrecked this once great lager completely. I understand that they still brew original Becks in Bremen, but the UK doesn't seem to be on the supply list. Definitely not in UK supermarkets.

Becks lager (4% ABV) as of 2020 is now nothing more than a brand name in the UK. A very poor lager with no good qualities, and is best served down the drain. It has really nasty notes that unleash themselves up your nose if the beer is anything but frozen solid. All own-brand supermarket lagers/pilsners brewed in Germany beat this beer hands down. 
Basically, it's another American attempt at a German lager, which we all know they can't do. Ruined for profit!
With great sadness, Becks ""lager"" 4.8% or 4% ABV, is 
just a messily odd-tasting and unpleasant lager that doesn't know what kind of brew it is, with a bitter after taste. It's like this lager is mourning it's own death and telling you about it's demise, when you take a taste of it. Very sad.

RIP original Becks lager.

Once greatly loved by the UK, now sadly missed.May 10, 2020"
Beck's,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"I didn't know that this is a US beer now. Perhaps that's why I found a four pack of pints for $4.99 at the downtown liquor store? When I tasted it, I looked for the sharp taste of hops I was accustomed to when I drank it in college. I got that, so, to me, it's still the Beck's I knew 25 years ago. I shall be more alert the next time I buy some, and I shall edit my review accordingly. Until then, it's still one of the best beers I buy regularly. I don't do craft beer. Too bad for me, maybe, but I have sixty a month spending cash, and it's got to stretch. I have also never drunk the German version, having spent my tour of duty stateside. So, if you don't have axes to grind over it's relocation, give it a try. I see no reason to believe that ImBev has violated the Purity Laws. If they decided to flatten the flavor then the joke's on me, but at $5 for a four-pint pack, really? You will buy much worse beer for the same price.

Update 5/20/20 I bought my second four pack ($4.49 this time!) and slowed down as I poured and tasted. Same slightly bitter aroma, same full-bodied taste. The taste that many complain about is the taste I enjoy. Tested it against Stella and they're very much two different beers. My wife prefers Stella because it's smoother and has a prettier pour (and the can! Petite, slim, pretty, chicks would dig it). I'll take Beck's, any day--it's still what I remembered and at $1.25 per 16-ounce can it's trending towards Hamm's price. Beck's tastes better than Hamm's.

Beck's,4.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,"Wow, hard to believe Beck's has come to this! At one time, many years ago, Beck's was synonomous with what a good German made beer should taste like. Since being brewed here in the US, the quality has declined significantly!

Straw gold, nice carbonation but the head is thin and weak. Flavor and mouthfeel follow suit, being thin and weak in both malt and hop flavors. One noticable flaw, and I have seen this mentioned several times, is that there is a skunkiness in the aroma, which can sometimes happen to bottles exposed to sunlight or bright artificial lighting, but even when the beer is poured from a can this trait seems to be there in some instances.

It is crisp and light when first tasted followed by a slight, bitter taste that takes a little getting used to, but that is part of the purity of this beer.

Overall this is a brilliantly crafted beverage. Definitely one every beer lover should seek out.Jun 18, 2021"
Duvel,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Clear burnt gold with a thick white blanket, especially considering the width of this Chimay glass, leaving all kinds of stalactite lacing with a tilt.

Classic Belgian phenols are featured, but a little spicier and more balanced, with a touch of toasted wheat character. It's pear and clove, but milder.

The round frothy body is a bit lighter than it first appears to be, finishing tingly and just barely semi-dry, almost wet.Jun 10, 2021"
Duvel,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.0,"Unlike the first few reviews I saw, mine were from 11.2 oz ""bottle conditioned"" bottles. My first experience with both bottles were a head that explodes from the bottle and form bubbles that looked like soap bubbles- but thankfully didn't taste like them! Like a tripel without the spice, very smooth, and tasty. Hazy amber, slightly fruity aroma. Had I not wore a lot of beer on my lap the way it came out- and yes, I was gentle in the extreme the second time- it would have been a flawless experience.Jun 06, 2021"
Duvel,4.0,4.25,4.5,4.25,"330 ml bottle poured into a chalice with a nice slightly hazy golden color, large white head that recedes but doesn't disappear, and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, green apple, citrus and Belgian yeast. Taste follows aroma with notes of grapefruit, spice, yeast, and a honey sweetness balanced by earthy/floral hops. Medium to full body with excellent/high carbonation and pleasant dry finish. Overall, a great world class beer.Jun 03, 2021"
Duvel,3.5,3.5,3.75,4.25,"This beer is like a cross between a Czech pilsner and a Belgian Tripel. Spicy and bitter with strong carbonation like a pils, with a citrus front and more weight and abv like a tripel. You can taste the high quality ingredients, a great dinner beer. A light euphoric and lingering buzz. Goes down smooth and easy like a session beer, but it is deceptively strong.May 27, 2021"
Duvel,4.0,2.25,4.5,4.25,"Only 11.2 ounces fit into the short squat brown bottle. Even if you don't like it, the experience shouldn't be drawn out. Concern arises as a deliberate pour into a clear pint glass produces a puffy white, but disingenuous head. It recedes quickly and unevenly. It's not pretty and this character often forecasts a body that will be too light. The color is pretty nice. It's a light copper-amber with a density about halfway between opaque and translucent. A fair amount of lacing graces the glass where the head has mercifully subsided. Aroma?, at best a little Belgian yeast can be detected. Despite some warning signs, this tastes pretty good. It does indeed have sufficient body that's in great balance with the malt, hops, yeast and alcohol balance. With each sip, or gulp, you can get all four sensations, with the alcohol never taking precedence above the others, despite the relatively high ABV. Light but richly flavorful and for a Belgian Ale, not close to being overly yeasty, this is a delightful brew to consume.May 03, 2021"
Duvel,3.75,3.5,3.5,4.0,"Pours a golden straw color with well over two fingers of head. The nose has that classic Belgian funk. The flavor is funky, herbal and oddly sweet. The body seems spot on.

The label on the bottle extollls the virtues of the brewer's creation of a new beer style. My reaction is that such an effort is remarkable only if the style is different and enjoyable. In this case, it's not.Apr 03, 2021"
Duvel,4.0,4.0,3.75,4.0,"30 mL bottle. Clear golden with a huge white head. Smells of Belgian yeast, herbal notes, slightly sweet fruitiness.

Duvel,4.25,3.75,4.25,4.5,"This is my second time trying this beer. The first time I had Duvel I thought it was a bit too spicy/clovey/peppery/bitter. This time I really enjoyed it. I drink it at a colder temperature rather than room temp or just slightly cooled because that dampens the spiciness and lets me enjoy it more. I like to drink most of my beers colder overall. If you think Duvel is too spicy or bitter then try drinking it at a cooler temperature. The beer reminds me of Leffe Blonde. Those pale, light, and crisp notes of clove, banana, pepper, spices, hops, tutti frutti bubble gum. Almost creamy with the mouth feel. I love the feel. Will be buying this more often as I initially wrote it off as something I don't enjoy. I'm glad I gave it a second chance. But definitely won't drink it without some fridge time as when it warms up it gets quite spicy and bitter.Jan 02, 2021"
Duvel,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Had a few times, most recently today. 

Look: Golden, slightly yellow. Rocky white head with lots of lacing and retention that lasts throughout the drink. 

Smell: citrus hops, sweet. Very complex, hint of alcohol spiciness. 

Taste: wonderful. Best thing about the brew. Mildly sour, slight citrus, very clean hoppy finish, but not overpowering. Aftertaste is lingering mild hop, some sweetness. 

Feel: light, crisp, fairly high carbonation. 

Overall: try it. Belgian ale, golden ale lovers, all beer lovers will find something to love in the beer that is the gold standard of its own classification: bottle aged strong golden ale. 

One of my top 5 all time.Jan 01, 2021"

Indica India Pale Ale,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,"This one is an average non descript ""American IPA"" - it's not east, west or anything in the middle just American. Very little aroma hops on this one, smells a bit dank, malty with a little pine just for fun. Taste is malty with a slight hop bitterness on the finish, no citrus just herbal pine hops - reminds me of a Long Hammer IPA or maybe a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.

Indica India Pale Ale,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.25,"My second one from Lost Coast but the fist one that I ever wanted to try from them.
A West Coast IPA, I love its hop flavor, dank and piney maybe is the right word. I loved its aroma and that the taste is almost to the same extent intensive. The feel is somewhat behind the former, making it feel slightly lighter than how it tastes but still is a great beer. I could get used to drinking such beers every day as standard.
“Find your happy place” it says, well, this is somewhere near there.Dec 28, 2019"
Indica India Pale Ale,4.0,4.25,4.0,4.25,"Poured into a tall clear pint glass. A glowing and hazy copper/amber color is present, steady rising bubbles, finger thick head with good retention.

Pine resin and citrus upfront. Oranges, grapefruit, lemon rind, some grass, prominent floral and herbal notes, biscuit, caramel, and honey. Very dank, florescent, and herbal. Good balance.

Sweet malts are upfront with the grassy hops. Honey and caramel are what come to mind firstly, then the bitter grapefruit and other citrus come in and through the end to the aftertaste. Follows the aroma well. Medium-bodied.Jun 07, 2019"
Indica India Pale Ale,3.5,3.5,3.75,4.0,"Lost Coast's flagship IPA is pretty much a standard West Coast IPA, with all that that implies. There's nothing fancy here, just a big hoppy ale, with plenty of bitterness. It's maybe just a shade maltier than many West Coast IPAs, but that's about the only departure from the norm. It's a good example of the style, but nothing remarkable.

Indica India Pale Ale,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"L: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had an amber color and a slightly hazy texture. There was a quarter inch of foamy, fairly long-lasting head. Pretty good, but not great, lacing. 

S: A nice aroma of hops, citrus, light malt, and pine.

T: Tasted of a decent amount of citrus (lemon, in particular), a good amount of hops, some pine resin notes, a tinge of malt, a tinge of grass (not too noticeable), and caramel. An interesting flavor that holds your interest. Well-balanced between the hops, fruit, and pine elements.

F: A solid amount of carbonation with a somewhat slick finish. Light- to medium-bodied.

O: A good IPA.Feb 06, 2017"
Indica India Pale Ale,3.75,3.75,4.0,4.25,"355ml bottle poured into a teku glass.

Mildly hazed body and copper amber color, the pour forms up thick frothy white head that stands with pretty good retention before gradually sinking to everlasting bubble film on the surface, some lacing patch can be seen here and there.

In a nose, it discloses the aromas of mild floral, citrus, lemon rind, resin, some pine, slight herbal, and grass. All of these scents are derived from its hoppy goodness while malt is not forgotten with notes of biscuit and some caramel.

The taste starts with various hop flavors ranging from citrus, lemon rind, resin, pine, grass, and herbal. Then it is malt running in parallel with notes of biscuit and sweet caramel while the finish is hop again with its soft bitterness. Overall, it tends to be balance as hop bitterness is not too much and there is some malt as leverage.

The body is medium with smooth mouthfeel from its lively carbonation generated soft effervescence sweeping through the palate. The feeling is very crisp, very refreshing, a bit clean, and dry finish.

Considering the ABV, it is likely not a session IPA, however, the feeling is just right and very easy to drink due to its clean character, also the crispness and balance. It is easily suit in any occasion.Dec 22, 2016"

Golden, orange. Semi opaque per the unfiltered brew. Soapy minimalist head. Looks good.
Smells like grass but with some kinda weirdness in it? Odd. Detecting some fairly muted typical WC hop notes.
Clean ale backbone with a layer of citrus hops laid over. I am really only detecting citrusy fruit, grapefruit, orange, what have you, fair bittetness. A little grassy?
Biting carbonation, lightish body, a little bit of syrupy thickness. Good

Smells like citrus and grapefruit, with some grass as well. Tastes like a pale ale, a subtle blend of caramel malt and funky hops. The aftertaste has a nice peppery aftertaste from the hops. It's a lighter bodied ale that's refreshing and I could easily drink a few. Overall, a nice beer. I'd like to try it fresh to see if it's any better.Mar 03, 2016"

This beer goes down smooth, maybe a little to smooth since I usually sip my IPA'S but found myself finishing this poured 22 oz bottle in half the usual time to finish one.

S- Hoppy-ish

T- Nice balance, though perhaps a bit on the malty side for an IPA. Caramel seems pervasive as well.

F- Good satisfying mouth feel, on the more carbonated side.

O- My first sip was a little too malty for my taste. Possibly because I was expecting a more hoppy experience. However, things balanced out after I drank a few more sips. I would buy this beer again (and likely will since they have it at our local S*way for a decent price).Oct 21, 2015"

I Crack!ed open the vent & beCAN a slow, steady, gentle C-Line Glug into the awaiting glass. It returned the favor an CANoperated by first evincing a pseudo-cascade & then by settling into two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, deep-tan/light-brown head with excellent retention. Color was Dark Brown to Very Dark Brown (SRM = > 27, < 34) with cola highlights throughout. Nose had a pleasant roastiness with notes of caramel, licorice and semi-sweet chocolate. Mmm. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, not quite creamy, but on the approach. The taste reminded me of caramel corn, or better, Cracker Jacks, since I also got a peanut-like flavor! Mmm. This was quite tasty & quite easy-drinking. I CAN envision a stein of this at a European restaurant with a nice central-European meal!

Finishes with a medium bitterness and some roasted/smokey notes lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.

Pretty nice Dark Lager with a good malt profile that subtly leans towards roasted/smokey notes and very light grassy/herbal hops for balance.Oct 24, 2018"

Not really a fan of this one...rationally it does taste pretty ok, it just doesn't really seem to be working for me, it's really heavy and doesn't have enough creaminess or smoothness...just tastes a bit flat and unexciting.Feb 18, 2018"
Kozel Dark,4.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,"This is a nice dark beer that pours smooth. It has a good amount of foam initially and then retains just a small line of foam after pouring. Right away I'm liking this beer just based on look and pour. My first taste was the foam because I had to drink off some of it to be able to fit the rest of the can into my glass. That first taste I picked up a large note of caramel in it. After the foam faded however so did the caramel flavor. It has a decent smell to the beer but not a very large bouquet. Its not a real heavy beer and has just a hint of bitterness to it. Overall I'm liking it more and more. I'll probably wait a couple more months for when it gets colder before I get another.Aug 13, 2017"

On tasting, it's a little strange. Lightweight, malty. There is a light boozy note almost as if it had been barrel aged for a few hours.

Very strong, alive, alcohol aroma. Can't detect any hops.

The herbal nature of Kronenbourg does not debase itself to the lower standards of Stella Artois' however this lager does not fullfill all the bodily requirements that a larger should posess, such as texture from carbonation and effervescent.

The skunk, while diminished, was still notable on the palate. The basic ""beer"" flavors were stronger, and the malts were nice and the hops floral.

The body was the expected and typical light of the style and had a dry finish.

Drinkability was fine, just what was expected.

Dundee Original Honey Brown Lager,3.0,3.25,3.0,2.75,"oz can into a pint glass. Coding on can no help in determining age, but my guess is this has some age on it 

The body is a crystal clear reddish amber color. Seems well carbonated, but there is zero head or lacing.

Light aroma, sweet malt with a touch of honey.

On tasting, a little odd. If anything, it feels a little over carbonated. It is very sweet. Also thin and watery.

Mouth between thin and medium, finish sweet.

Overall, no unpleasant tastes, but no substance either. 12oz would have been quite enough.Sep 04, 2021"
Dundee Original Honey Brown Lager,2.75,3.0,3.0,2.5,"Can, stamped D091, April 1? Pokal glass.

A: pours a brilliant, brassy gold with loads of carbonation and a foamy white head that dissipates to nothing almost immediately. No lacing to speak of.

S: faint cereal grain, perhaps some cooked cabbage. I’m going to put sound with smell, because I can hear crackling bubbles coming from this.

T: really quite faint, sweet cereal. Honey Nut Cheerios? There is something artificial tasting in there. It has the perception of sweetness without actually being all that sweet. As it warms, that taste becomes more and more apparent and unpleasant.

M: thin, highly carbonated. Not totally clean on the finish. Wish it had more oomph, even for a lager this isn’t really satisfying.

O: back in my early 20’s this stood head and shoulders above most of the macro lagers my friends and I drank. Today it is a shadow of its former self. It is not even as dark as I remember (but I’m no fan of artificial coloring, so maybe that is for the best). It does not seem flawed, just a slightly sweeter AAL. Accomplishes what it sets out to do. In fact, at $1.69 for a 24 ounce can, it really is a tremendous value in its market segment. It’s just one I don’t intend to frequent.Jul 29, 2021"

T - Honey, cereal grain, and a floral sort of finish.

O - I've had this beer before, and I'm happy to finally formally review it! It's a simple brew, but not a really bad one. I'd even go as far as to call it an enjoyable beer! If you like Honey Nut Cheerios, this is just the liquid version of that. An arguably excellent beer pong beer.

Dundee Original Honey Brown Lager,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.25,"From a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Date unknown but it was bought shortly after the Genesee rebrand so assuming it's fresh.

Pours a translucent pale yellow with about a finger and a half of white head which dissipates fairly quickly down to nothing. No lacing. Tiny carbonation bubbles rising form the bottom of the glass.

Smells faintly sweet bread and, well, beer. It kind of smells like beer. Like the kind I would sneak a sip of when I was a kid and my dad wasn't looking. Also a bit of alcohol and skunkiness in there as well.

Taste is sweet. Picking up some breadiness but the honey is prominent-quite noticeable. I don't have a problem with the sweetness, but it is pretty powerful.

Mouthfeel is light. Above average carbonation. Not much of an aftertaste. 

Overall, it's enjoyable. I remember drinking this under the Dundee label many moons ago. Thought I was pretty sophisticated back then. It's a nice jog down memory lane at a nice price.Nov 20, 2020"
Dundee Original Honey Brown Lager,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass
Appearance - The beer pours a deep amber color with a touch of brown and a one finger head of foam. The head fades fast leaving a touch of lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell -The aroma of the brew is of sweet honey and brown bread with a touch of grain. It smells a bit like honey but Cheerios. Quite nice!
Taste -. The taste follows the nose well, beginning with a decent hit of caramel and honey, as well as a bit of grain and toast. As the taste advanced the grain gets a bit more potent while the honey amps up a whole lot. In the end one is left with a sweet but robust honey taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel - The body of the beer is thicker and creamier for a 4.5 % beer with a carbonation level that is average. For the sweet honey and brown bread flavor the feel is great and makes for a very easy-going drinker.
Overall- This is a flavorful and we'll crafted brew with a nice honey flavor!! Easy drinking and good.May 26, 2020"

S: ultra-weak aroma intensity... try as I may - and I nearly collapsed a lung in doing so - could not pick up much of anything aside from a whisper-soft toasty caramel biscuit hint... the glass was barely cool to the touch, and just pure weak-itude

T: pretty much a watery malt liquor foundation with a soft kiss of toasty malt syrup (almost a maple aftertaste, but I could be stretching)... very little lingering flavor aside from a vague medium crystal malt character in the back of the palate; weak grassy bitterness builds... subsequent big sips detect a bit more reach to the malt sweetness, but it cuts off hard in the finish

F: rather clean, to a fault... its color and its name had me fooled into expecting more (German, malty, bock-y) body, but alas it's almost too thin and subtly sizzly, but ultimately poundable

O: first time having this in over 20 years; certainly the first time from a glass; couldn't find a pounder can, caved in on a sixer... what an unimpressive taste, nearly devoid of character - had hopes of a lil something more, though it's a decent (cheap) alternative to an AAL... drink it (cold) from the bottle (was a lil more enjoyable that way) and imagine 'honey', 'brown', and 'extra rich' - maybe you can trick your brain (1514)Sep 23, 2019"

The only redeeming quality of this beer is that when it is very cold, it is refreshing. There's essentially no flavor to it - just crisp ""coldness."" There's a little bit of grain sweetness, and it finishes surprisingly dry.

I mean, it is still below average, for being a tasteless, overcarbonated dry Adjunct - but let's admit, even still it is better than most of the Euro Lagers we have here in Hungary.

San Miguel Light,2.75,2.5,2.0,2.25,"A college chum of mine recently did some overseas charity work and brought back various southeast Asian CANs for me. More proof that it pays to advertise where The CANQuest (tm) is CANcerned!

From the CAN: ""Since 1890""; ""Only 100 Calories""; ""Pale Pilsen""; ""Expertly Brewed and Produced by San Miguel Brewery Inc. for Domestic Sale Only""; ""Keep the Philippines clean. Dispose of properly.""; ""San Mig Light only has 100 calories[,] that's why you'll feel light as you enjoy its full beer flavor that's brewed just right. A superior beer brewed in the San Miguel tradition of excellence.""

It was a tougher Crack! than usual, perhaps because the vent was more oval-shaped than circular. Once opened, I CANducted a gentle Glug, followed by a swirl in the glass, producing a finger of foamy, bone-white head with minimal retention. Color was Pale-Straw (SRM = 1 - 2) with NE-quality clarity, allowing me to see into the future. It is going to be really cold tonight! Nose smelled lightly sour, and it was hard to pinpoint the culprit, but the Ingredients mentioned ""Cereals/Sugar"". Ah, how reminiscent of the early days of The CANQuest (tm), when AALs and Light Lagers were the norm. Mouthfeel was thin, watery. No surprise. The taste was, well, rather tasteless. It had a light grapiness with a mild biscuitiness, but it was so light as to be well under the radar. Finish was semi-dry, refreshing, but a glass of water would have had the same effects. This was not bad, just really bland and boring.Feb 13, 2016"
San Miguel Light,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.25,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass

Appearance – The beer pours a golden straw color with a two finger head of pure white foam. The head has a decent level of retention, fading over time to leave a bit of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

Smell – The aroma of the brew rather nice for a light brew in a clear bottle. While I was expecting tons of skunk, there was none, instead the brews aroma was quite strong of a cereal smell; sorta like cheerios. Along with these smells comes some corn syrup and a bit of caramel as well.

Taste – The taste begins with a bready taste mixed with some caramel. As the taste moves on, some of the caramel fades, being replaced by a blend of light fruits and corn syrup sweetness. All the while some hay and grass develop in the middle of the tongue, with them only fading later more toward the end of the taste. With the flavors that are left at the end of the taste, and with a little bit of a cardboard taste that comes at the very end, one is left with a malty, lightly off (cardboard and corn) taste to linger on the tongue. 

Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is thin with a carbonation level that is on the higher side. For the somewhat off and lighter abv. of the brew the feel is quite appropriate and makes for a more easy drinking brew overall.

Overall – A decent light brew overall. Its aroma was very surprising to me, but its flavor was a bit lacking. Nothing all that hot here, but hey, if you are drinking a light beer looking for tons of flavor, then you are automatically barking up the wrong tree. Also for only 100 calories for the 11.2 fl.oz bottle, this light beer packs more punch then the average light beer so….Dec 04, 2015"
San Miguel Light,2.5,2.25,1.75,2.0,"Crystal clear light straw gold with fine and fluffy pure white head of lower retention. Not bad lacing though. Smells like table honey. Similar to a Dos Equis (I should know, had one earlier today). Taste is way different though. Honey component is still there, but for the most part it's — I don't know what else to call it — dry hay, with kind of a medicinal (but non-phenolic) finish as well. While all of this doesn't make me gag, it's far from a compliment. I'm not a horse. I pity the people who feel they have to drink this over not only other San Miguel offerings, but most other light beers. I wouldn't even call it bad, I just have a hard time recognizing it as a beer. At least as far as flavor is concerned. Appearance, aroma, and mouthfeel are all okay or tolerable. Very light body, lots of spritz. This makes it easier to ignore what it tastes like, I think. Surprisingly astringent for what it is, but bubbles up after it's been swallowed. I don't weight my ratings according to a beer's style or price point. I rate them all as 'beer'. So while this may be a decent bang for buck, or even alright for the style, it's just not a good beer, or even a good light beer. Glad I got to try it though.Oct 13, 2015"

T: The taste has light flavors of adjunct and grainy malts along with more subdued hints of skunk. No bitterness is perceptible, although there seems to be enough hops to mask any sweetness from being noticeable. 
M: It feels light-bodied, thin and watery on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.

Citrus & cut grass with some skunk and basic adjuncts to start. There is a weak, almost water like taste that follows this and a tiny bit of bitterness.

Light & watery with almost no bitterness. Slightly tangy with strong carbonation that borders on gassy.

Bland & watery with a weak taste and smell, one that certainly lives up to its 'light' billing. The beer seems over carbonated and doesn't have much of note to say for itself.Sep 11, 2013"

The body is thin and watery. But it would be easy to pound down quickly on a hot day like a glass of water.

Not too heavy, and not too hoppy (even though I do prefer an IPA occasionally.) I assigned the lowest rating for smell--admittedly, it does come off as a bit ""musty,"" but I typically do not smell my beer before I drink it. Leave the ""olfactory test"" to the wine snobs!

I expected it to be bad when I bought this as a joke with friends in honour of the high school days and it was just way over the top bad. 
The mouthfeel is super light and carbonation is high. Not a good mouthfeel.

So the weird thing with this beer that really threw me off is that it's labelled as ""pilsner."" This thing is nothing close to a pilsner. The malt just doesn't seem to exist the only thing it provides is this bready character but it isn't balanced whatsoever it's like they didn't even try.

Looks splendid in the glass. Deep, deep auburn colored body. Decent off white head persists in good form throughout, leaving scattered lacing

Kind of a caramel aroma without the sweetness.

On tasting, sweeter than the nose would suggest. The balance is a little more bitter than roasty.

Mouth between medium and full, finish a light to medium bitter roast.

Overall, an okay beer. Appreciate the effort at balance. Haven't had many Belgian brown ales, this was just okay.Oct 03, 2021"

Feel: Sparkly, too carbonated. A light to medium body.

Slightly disappointing to have my first Belgian Brown be past freshness, but I'm sure it'll still be good. It's my fault anyways, had this one sitting around for quite some time but just never got around to it

Pours a clear dark brown with a red glow around the edges and with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing

The aroma seemed more spiced than malty here, lots of clove, cinnamon, lightly citrusy hops, and some brown sugary malt

The front end of the sip had a nice warmth, bringing notes of caramel malt, toast, and subtle dark fruits with a touch of general citrus. The swallow brings notes of dry spice, some pepper and clove along with a light malty sweetness

A nice medium body pairs with gentle carbonation for a sweet and slightly sticky beer. Finishes more sticky than it starts, it coats the mouth but it actually works here

Taste is nice malty bread notes with a good caramel and toffee hints light nuttiness and banana appear towards the finish along with a good dose of clove and yeast esters with some smokey hints. Flavor is good descent little Belgium Brown and cheap too.

Fuller's London Pride,3.75,3.0,3.0,3.0,"Currently ranked #4 on the ""Bitter - English"" top beers list.

4-pack of 330ml brown glass bottles with pry-off crown caps ran me $8.79 USD plus tax at a Total Wine & More in Metairie, Louisiana. Best before: 01 Nov 21.

4.7% ABV (rather high for a best bitter by my estimation). Brewed with ""...British malt and a diverse blend of Target, Goldings, Challenger & Northdown hops.""

Served cold into a dimpled mug. I dig the classic looking regal red label/cap and the slim profile of the bottle.

APPEARANCE: Straw-tawny body colour. Looks rich and robust and boasts a gilded vibrance. Head is thicker than I'd expected, also looking robust. Frothy and inviting. Head retention is excellent (~10+ minutes). ~3cm head height.

AROMA: Dry biscuity ale yeast. Naked hop bitterness. A hint of orange marmalade. Creaminess. 2-row and caramel malts. I'm not getting much resin from the Northdown hops nor much spiciness or earthiness from the Goldings.

Promises a drinkable beer with a bitter yet subtly fruity flavour profile and a rich malt backbone.

TASTE & TEXTURE: Dry yet rich - or at least richer than I'd have imagined a 4.7% ABV beer would be. Scintillae of marmalade, caramel, toffee, and dried citrus fruit peel. 2-row/pale malt and some caramalt seem to comprise this beer's simplistic malt backbone.

Alcohol is well disguised.

Wet, unrefreshing, well carbonated, somewhat soft, medium-bodied.

OVERALL: I can't say it's not true to the style, but I can say it's a bit underwhelming in comparison to Adnams Bitter or even Goose Island's Honkers. I wouldn't honestly buy this beer again unless it was on cask in some traditional pub in England and I felt compelled, but maybe that says more about my relative lack of love for English best bitters than it does about this beer. I don't see what's here that isn't done better by other breweries, and despite the heavy marketing Fuller's does for this I don't find it better than its primary competition in the U.K., Australia, and (even) U.S.A. Above average at best, and I say that as someone who doesn't dislike the style outright (even if does happen to be one of those I least cherish unless tremendously well executed).

Fuller's London Pride,4.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Fuller’s London Pride is crystal clear and a deep copper in color. Head is dense, cream colored, and lasting.
The first thing I notice when I go in for a sniff is how distinctly British this beer’s nose is. Which is to say it’s a melange of caramel, malt, and what smells at first like a variety of ripe fruit esters. On closer examination, caramel maltiness takes the lead, giving the aroma a certain depth. There may be a hint of bready malts in there, but it’s really the caramel that takes point here. All of this comes together in the end, fading into a sort of sweet finish.
My first impression of Fuller’s London Pride is of a smooth, medium bodied beer with pinpoint carbonation dancing across my palate. On closer examination, I’m getting flavors of caramel and a sweetness from flavors of ripe berries. Minimal breadiness works its way into the mix but without as much presence as one would hope.

Fuller's London Pride,4.0,4.0,4.25,4.25,"Poured from bottle into nonic pint glass.

The finish is bitter, fruity, herbal and lingers for a while in the aftertaste. Feel is light, smooth, enough carbonation to keep it solid, but not aggressively carbonated.

Great White,3.5,4.0,3.25,3.25,"I just drank a Hoegaarden and Pearl from Tree House the other night, and this isn't even in the same league. That being said, it's not terrible. I would say the strongest aspect is the smell - it has a very appetizing spicy smell to it, but the taste just doesn't follow suit. It's very flat and dry, and the taste is basically gone before you've swallowed it. I'm a fan of a number of other Great Lakes beers, but this is not one I'll seek out again.May 07, 2020"
Great White,4.0,4.0,3.75,4.5,"Drank out of a bottle.
This was my first from Great Lakes Brewing, and a great first impression! Very crisp beer with a pleasant note of banana at the front end and a bit of spice, specifically clove, at the back end. It has a refreshing mouthfeel, though a little dry. Overall a very fine beer!Apr 27, 2020"
Great White,3.5,1.5,2.5,2.5,"Poured into a pilsner style glass. Thin white head which dissipates quickly. Hazy color. Mild lacing on the glass.

I am not a fan of white ale, Belgian styles, or Heffeweizzen due to their ""milky"" aftertastes. People say ""bananas and cloves."" Maybe my palate is terrible but I get none of that. I need a malty and hoppy mouthfeel but here I just get heavy and gritty.Nov 17, 2019"

A: Pours a crystal clear, golden color with a one half finger, white head, solid retention and complex lacing.
S: Very light nose. I thought I could pick up aromas of caramel and maybe banana and spice (?cloves) at points.
T: Semisweet. The palate basically follows the nose but far more banana. Less than subtle bitterness, actually a touch peppery.
M: Light bodied with moderate carbonation. A bit watery for this style.
O: A touch too subtle for a Belgian Witbier without being flavor forward (more flavor backward). Drinkable, but just.Jun 19, 2019"
Great White,4.0,3.25,3.25,3.5,"Appearance: Pours a deep orange color that is cloudy. A strong head.
Aroma: Flowers and spices. Coriander and some clove. A flower aroma too.
Flavor: A floral perfume presence. A little funkiness from the flower. Lots of clove and some coriander. Flavors are otherwise somewhat weak. Little to no fruit. Yeast on the back-end. Little malt presence. Mostly flowers and clove on the flavor. Sort of reminds me of an artificial banana pancake wrapped in a band-aid.
Feel: Medium bodied for the style. Good carbonation. Finishes dry. Alcohol is hidden. Some residual Belgian spice flavor on the tongue.

Overall: Not sure what is off about this witbier The chamonille is a nice addition, but otherwise it's kind of weak on flavor. Fruit and malts are not there, and so you've got a bitter flower taste cleaned further by dry by clove and yeast. It needs another element. It has the spices, just not the flavor. Nice flower and Belgian spice flavors, but lacks roundness and just doesn't hit it for me.Jun 12, 2019"

Great White,3.25,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Because my copy is a month past its Best By date, I'm drinking an ale that is slightly not-as-good as most other ratings.
However, this wit's blandness does not mean it is not well-crafted; sometimes requiring skill in this difficult and subtle style.

Looks are average. But Smells offer the common wit aromas, plus some banana. Tastes follow, but the fruitiness and spices and malts all play nicely, balanced and nothing tries to over-assert itself. Yet it is still refreshing. As a wheat beer, the mouth is soft.

Great White,1.75,4.0,4.25,4.0,"Turbid pinkish orange body with a coarse pinkish head that fades, leaving minute lace. The nose gives a burst of raspberry and flowers, sweetness, spice, and mild wheat. The taste is nicely beer-y, with wheat and clove, nutmeg (white ale) with a hearty, assertive, but not over-the-top helping of delicious raspberry. Off-dry. Slight powderiness. The body is light, with sharp carbonation.
This is the most assertive but balanced fruit beer I think I've ever had. Raspberries are predominant throughout, but there is plenty of uncontested beer flavor to ground it. Wonderful, will be returning.

Smell is quite pleasant - nice breadiness, then some light to moderate spice with clove, banana, maybe some allspice, light floral chamomile.

Taste follows aroma with bread and wheat, light toast, then some yeast and yeast based flavors of spice, clove, banana, light chamomile. 

Mouthfeel is moderately carbonated, light lingering sweetness, then a quite sharp dry finish that lingers on the tongue.

pleasing faint aroma of oranges.

a very refreshing drink. orange peel comes through, but not heavily citrus. camomile is faint, and coriander is hard to detect, but the drink doesn't lose much for it.

Great White,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass and a mug. The head in the mug was at least a good finger and a half more than what was in the pint glass. Other than that, here’s the rest. The appearance was a fairly decent light hazy golden yellow color. The head faded at a nice pace and allowed a decent speckled sort of lacing gracing the sides of both glasses. The smell had a yeasty/slightly bready aroma rolling over top of some light lemon and banana. The taste starts off bready but leads to a fairly decent lighter citrus lemon flavor. The aftertaste was about the same and lead to a dry finish. On the palate, this one sat fairly light and yet still had a good carbonation for a witbier - harsh but not overly done. Overall, I say this was a fairly easy drinking beer - good for a witbier and more than definitely to have in the Summers.Jun 29, 2017"
Guinness Draught,4.25,3.25,3.25,4.25,"Look: Dark, opaque black with a finger size foam head on the pour. Adequate lacing down the glass.

Smell: Slight roasted coffee with a hint of chocolate

Taste: Slight dark coffee and chocolate taste, roasted malt is the most prevalent with a slight bitter finish.

Feel: Smooth and creamy due to the nitrogen.

Overall: This is the beer that got me into stouts and porters. A sessionable, light stout that's smooth on the way in, presents a roasted malt taste, and leaves with a slight bitter finish. A go-to for me.Oct 10, 2021"
Guinness Draught,4.25,3.75,3.5,4.5,"This has great mouthfeel- smooth, very fine bubbles and foam. This compliments the lighter flavor profile of this stout compared to some of the more intense ones out there.Oct 03, 2021"

Guinness Draught,4.25,4.0,3.0,4.0,"This was made by accident. They heated the malt to the point of 500L and 300L malts and blended them together to get this carbon charcoal red color and fermented it anyway and well... people liked it! I am not one of those people, but I only have a pint of Guinness with my dad for St Patrick's day. On that day I will have 4 pints of Harp, 4 Pints of Smithwick's and then move to Guinness. This is not a starter beer. This is a low calorie low alcohol beer that is good with perpetual stew, bread, and also bangers and mash for Irish Breakfast the day of marching in a parade to ""piss on the queen"".Sep 18, 2021"
Guinness Draught,3.75,2.5,2.0,2.25,"It looks like Guinness stout and that’s about it. This has little smell and tastes more like a watery porter than a stout. It’s like drinking a stout light because everything is muted. Pass on this one.Sep 10, 2021"
Guinness Draught,4.0,3.5,2.75,2.0,"Drank this beer all summer, having done so I'm not sure if I'll drink Guinness anytime soon. It's very 'Guinessy'. It's what you expect when looking at it: thick, creamy, coffee tasting, smooth. If beer had a desert, this would be it. But because it's so distinctive and after you have become accustomed with the taste, it's hard to envision you drinking the beer in any common setting you would normally drink beer. The plastic ball in the can is also not very flattering.Aug 31, 2021"
Guinness Draught,5.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,"L- It is a very dark brown almost black stout that slowly forms a really nice looking light brown almost latte-like head made up of really small bubbles that gives the beer a creamy texture. Probably my favorite looking commercial beer.

S- Really faint toasted malt aromas, I expected it to be a bit more aromatic but it is very insipid in this aspect.

T- The smell of toasted malts are more present when you taste it but not as much as I would like, I also detect some notes of nuts such as almonds or cashews and with a hint of yeasts from the brewing process. There are not much hops present in the taste but I detect a very faint hoppy bitter aftertaste.

F- The beer itself is a bit watery but the head gives the beer a really nice creamy texture that I really enjoy so make sure you put a really nice thick head.

O- Really good beer for being a commercial one. I would prefer the taste to be a little stronger, more malty like the bottled one but I really enjoy the texture and the casual taste it gives. I could drink 2 of these or more no problem by itself or with some food. I will definitely try this again when I can.Aug 21, 2021"
Guinness Draught,4.0,3.5,3.75,4.5,"Kind of overrated beer for me. Was really looking forward for a pint of this legendary beer in Ireland. Turns out it tastes a bit weaker than I would expect. Not great not terrible. I personally don’t like dark beers that much but i gave this a chance. I wasn’t surprised, nor disappointed. Would say 3,6 - not great, not terrible.Aug 09, 2021"
Guinness Draught,4.75,3.5,3.75,4.5,"Ah, Guinness. The go-to Irish Dry that can be found anywhere, and luckily its a pretty good stout!

This stout was from a 4 pack of nitro cans. Pours deep black into my traditional pint glass. At first pour, the beer is full of foams that coalesces upward into a 3/4in creamy head with bubbles so fine they are impossible to make out with the naked eye. The tan cream head floating on top of a black liquid can only be found elsewhere in a root beer float. As with a root beer float, this is certainly a treat.

While having an impactful look, the smell is more subtle of malt, roasted grain, and a slight bitterness. I really don’t pick up the coffee or more nuanced smells that other reviewers get.

The taste of Guinness isn’t something novel or noteworthy. It has a simple palate of malt, roast, earthy minerals and maybe if you really look for it the bite of coffee without the traditional flavor of coffee. It is balanced, smooth and nonoffensive.

The feel is where the Irish Dry Stouts are absolutely loved by beer drinkers like me. To be such a dark color with a creamy head you’d think it would be thick and strong. However, an Irish Dry is remarkably cool, refreshing and disappears before going down making it a light feeling beer. Guinness has perfected this feeling with its heavy entry and light exit as if half the beer transported away somewhere between the tip of my tongue and the back of my mouth. It is a unique and refreshing feeling.

Overall, a Guinness stout is the staple example of an Irish Dry Stout and is remarkable in its consistency, world-wide delivery quality, and provenance. While the flavors aren’t something to write home about, the holistic experience of the feel, look, smell, and taste make it a national treasure to Ireland and I can definitely see why. Guinness is my go-to Irish Dry. Although in Ireland, I did enjoy Beamish slightly more from the tap. However, here in the states, long live Guinness!Aug 01, 2021"
Guinness Draught,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.75,"Actually, my first Guinness ever. I’ve used it for cooking brats before (doing that now), but I’ve actually never tried one until now. I knew I liked it for cooking but have always heard very mixed reviews on it, so I’ve just stuck with styles and beers I know I like. Overall, I really dont see what all the fuss is about, positive or negative. It’s just not anything very special. It pours smooth, the color of cola, but a bit clearer. Not so clear you can see through the glass, but you can definitely tell it’s truly a dark brown, with a bit of a burgundy hue, not a black like I expected from it. Head is pretty small, only about one finger, if that, with a few rocky bubbles but mostly fine bubbles nestled in compactly with each other. Also not entirely what I’d expected. The smell is a bit faint. I can certainly smell some dark chocolate notes, and heavy malt, but nothing that really punches you in the face. I expected a smell that would immediately say “I’m a f***in Guinness!”. Just wasn’t there. Feels smooth going down, a little more roughly carbonated than I like in a stout, but still quite smooth. It tastes a bit earthy, with lots of coffee notes, and certainly a bit of chocolate on the finish, but overall, just not really “wowed” by it. It’s alright. I finish the extra one I bought and probably not have another one unless someone has it on hand at a dinner or bbq. It’s not a bad beer, but it’s not awesome either. Just somewhere in the middle. I’d say it’s mostly on point for a stout as far as texture and WHAT flavors you get off of it, but I vastly prefer a very strong stout to this. Again, really not sure why this beer seems to be so polarizing. Some LOVE it. Some HATE it. Not really seeing where either of those fit in.Jul 27, 2021"

Guinness Draught,4.0,3.0,3.25,3.75,"Was really looking forward to this, and have to say I was a bit disappointed. Clearly the initial look was fabulous given the nitro widget. Thick, creamy tan head and the first couple sips were silky smooth given the nitro. And the dark malt bitters (not really hops) were a nice complement to the initial creamy feel. Unfortunately it falls apart after a good opening. There was little lacing and the head collapses to a thin white veneer. While there was no tinny aftertaste (I'm pointing at you Boddingtons), the flavor profile descended to something like slightly bitter dark water ... not unpleasant but not a lot there. Maybe the solution is to knock one back in 5 mins and move on to the next beer?Jun 02, 2021"
Guinness Draught,4.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Guinness Draught pours into my glass deep, sullen, ruby red in color, just verging on pitch black. The head is dense, mousse like, and coffee cream in color. The head is lasting.

Up front aromas give me something minerally in nature. It's somewhere in between naturally occurring chalk formations and smelling the ocean itself. Hints of roasted coffee lend immediate support before moving into what smells like a combination of caramel and nuttiness. Everything combines to give Guinness' nose a slightly leathered quality before moving on to a short, cropped finish.

On the tongue, Guinness is full, smooth, and luscious. Mineral flavors up front remind me somehow of the sea before moving into very subtle hints of roasted dark grain. Hints of caramel provide a pleasant, but not overpowering sweetness. There's also that little bit of nuttiness helping Guinness keep its overall structure. Flavors finish off with a nice little hit of roasted coffee before fading into the night.

Guinness is full, rich, and smooth. It's pleasant and balanced in its own right. For such a dark, full bodied beer however, it lacks a certain level of assertiveness or robustness in its flavor and aroma. Which is all the more disappointing when you consider that Guinness is THE original Irish stout.May 24, 2021"

It is thick and heavy feeling, but not heavy drinking. The low ABV keeps it drinkable while being chewy, a huge plus. It is not sweet and sticky, but rich and smooth.

Grolsch Premium Lager,3.25,3.0,3.0,3.0,"I cannot say that there is anything special about the Euro Pale lager. The taste is mostly Bleh and the finish is kind of sharp, Imo. It is not a horrible beer at all, but I just do not think it is an awesome example of the style.Mar 29, 2021"
Grolsch Premium Lager,4.0,4.25,4.25,4.5,"Appearance: Pours a clear, medium, pale orange color with a soft white head. SRM of 8-9. (3.75)

Aroma: Mild aromas of pale bread malts, cereal grains, with a faint grassy hop character. (4.00)

Flavor: The flavor follows with white and pale cereal grains, with a slight grass hop flavor to it. 

Feel: Drinks very clean with appropriate carbonation. 

Compared to Heineken in the bottle 3/14/21: Pours a darker color. Slightly more honey and grassy hops. Less bread and skunk. More complex and graduated flavors. Winner: Grolsch. 

Overall: This one impressed me for a European pale lager. Really nice cereal grain flavors with authentic German hops that are grassy, yet very subtle. Drinks incredibly clean with a near perfect level of carbonation that allows it a smooth, yet clean drinking beer. 
I was skeptical of light-struck due to the green bottle, but this was not the case. As others have mentioned this is much better than a Heineken. An impressive European Pale Lager.

Grolsch Premium Lager,3.0,2.75,3.0,3.0,"An upgraded Heineken for sure. A light bodied easily drinkable euro pale ale with a slightly skunky and bitter after taste.

Grolsch Premium Lager,2.5,2.5,2.75,3.75,"There's not a whole lot to say about this beer. It's about as standard as it gets for pale lagers. It tastes kind of similar to how all the big beer adjuncts do except it's actually quite good by comparison. Bready malt and very earthy tones with a kind of corny taste but quite crisp and it has a lot more going for it than I expected. The carbonation is great and I mean it's not terrible. After trying so many vastly superior craft beers and with the selection of fantastic beer in my city, there's no reason to buy this.

At that point its not a beer anymore, its a wine or something else, but anyway, this beer here in my opinion, is the greatest beer In the world, super crisp in taste very refreshing, goes down smooth. You can drink these down without being worried of getting too drunk, this beer will always be my go to beer, I buy them by the 12 packs and drink them down at home, get you one I bet you won't be dissatisfied, you can drink these down and they are so delicious.Jan 03, 2021"
Grolsch Premium Lager,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.0,"What can be said about a beer that shares its name with the sound emanating from a grown man sitting on a bench with a full adult diaper? Grolsch. I first had this beer when I visited my diabetic compadre Gordon Van Blevins in the Netherlands back in the 2009, while he was working with legendary cinematographer Goof de Koning on the film “The Human Centipede”. After a full day of assisting 3 actors “surgically connected mouth-to-anus”, Gordon needed to wet his palate and clear his mind. Grabbing two massive green bottles of Grolsch, we popped the flip-tops and admired their beauty. 

Not unlike an adult diaper, a large foam head rapidly shot out from the opening, leaving a film throughout. Poured a clear yellow color with a touch of dark straw, followed with grassy hops and a light biscuit malt. As it turned out, Gordon was deathly allergic to alcohol and immediately collapsed and died.

450ml green swingtop bottle served in a big snifter. Best before APR0821. I find it very strange that I'm reviewing under a listing that was added today and had no reviews at the time that I started this. Is this some unheard of variety of Grolsch? Yet it's exactly what's written on the label...

Pours a honey amber color, nice and clear, with a medium to small head. Smell is lager yeast, a little grass.

Taste is a little water. Grain, a little grass, a little lager yeast. Not bad, just not much to it.

The taste is semisweet toasted and pale malt with a hint of floral hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied with average carbonation and a dry finish. Cleanly lagered.

Light bodied and crisp and easy to drink. The carbonation is moderate and feels right on par. Clean flavors of cereal grain and developing bready and caramel malt sweetness. There is a touch of easy going hops bitterness and grassy flavors. The finish is clean, short and dry. 

I used to drink this in the 90s as a college student, thinking that because it was an import, it was sophisticated. Knowing what I know now, I wasn’t expecting much given the green bottle.

The nose is clean, crisp, with moderate skunk owing to the green bottle and a little bit of melanoidin malt character. The mouthfeel is soft, light bodied, clean, refreshing and very easy to drink. The taste is of delicate malt, skunk (which I don't mind at all in eurolagers), very mild bitterness and a lightly sweet residual grainy finish.

Appearance - Pours large white sudsy head with decent retention. Collapses in on itself and leaves a thin, irregular, loose lacing with low-decent stick. Hazy medium gold body with a slight orange tinge. 3.5

Smell - Smells exactly of tangerine with faint musky grain undertones. Light and refreshing. Exactly what I expected it to smell like . 4

Unfortunately, it tastes like orange hard candy, and very quickly dries out the mouth. 

Mouth is a little above medium, finish tangerine and very dry.

Smell: Tangerine, tangerine, and more tangerine. Overall strong citrus smelling, predominantly tangerine and orange. Nothing else really. For what it is, it smells good, but does have an orange soda or medicinal orange smell to it. No evidence that this is a beer. 

Taste: Tangerine and citrus fruit up front, with an evident sweetness. Slight wheat presence, but minimal. I am not sure, but I know I can't drink much of this. It is too medicinal tasting.

Tangerine Wheat,4.25,4.0,3.75,3.5,"5.5% ABV | 15 IBU

The looks is very inviting initially but fades over time. Pours a nice hazy orange with a small about of head and practically no lacing.

The smell is immediate tangerine/orange that takes away from any hops or malt that you could get from this one.

The taste on this one follows exactly what you would expect from the nose. This beer doesn't resemble any beer taste at all but by no means does that mean it's bad. It is full of citrus juiciness. 

The feel is very smooth with almost no carbonation. Very light and juicy.

Overall this is a good beer to mix in a flight or one cold pint at the bar. I would classify this as an adult Sunkist. It's a light,refreshing beer that won't over power you with hops or a malty taste. This wheat beer can be enjoyed by anyone but if you like something stronger that brings some punch to the table...this beer isn't for you.May 30, 2017"

You only get the faintest beer taste, but so what! As long as these beers keep their taste while drinking and don't get a flat taste, they're awesome! And this one keeps its taste.

Overall this is an excellent example of a German Pilsner. Especially at less than 3 months old and @ $5.99 for a 500 ml 4 pack.Jun 13, 2021"

Bitburger Premium Pils,3.5,3.0,4.25,4.25,"Look... Pale clear yellow. It looks like very carbonated beer. The kind of beer i like to chug when thirsty Cheers
Smell...faint smell of rice and hops and not much going on here compared to some of the incredible smells of craft beers overall. I am not sure if you can consider Bitburger craft because of the immense mountains of cans they sell all over the world. 
Taste...rice driven front end until a sweet maltiness comes on to a ridiculously crisp. yum
Feel...a great part of this beer. Zesty perfection that invites consumption. prickly
Overall... i am definitely going to be prepping these ice cold in the cooler on a hot day, yup. Very nice to me and would recommend to anyone who likes Helles and Pilsners. Freshness is my only concern and i like to grab these where there is a good rotation on these. I believe there are dates of canning or BB on the can on the packageApr 07, 2021"
Bitburger Premium Pils,3.25,3.5,3.75,3.75,"The color is bright yellow and transparent with rapidly rising bubbles and good lacing. It smells of spicy hops and straw. A burst of floral notes on the palate along with classic hallertau hops and a touch of sweet malt. It feels pleasantly soft. All around a great and pure Pilsner. True to style and complex in subtlety. I think it is one of the better available commercial Pils in the USA.Mar 27, 2021"
Bitburger Premium Pils,4.5,4.0,4.25,3.75,"Can dated: 10/21/20

L: Pours a pale straw color with excellent clarity. A gentle pour yields two fingers of fine, white head. The head has good retention falling to a substantial 3mm ring around the circumference of the glass with a splotchy film of head in the middle of the glass sustained by a plethora of carbonation streamers rising from the bottom. It leaves a nice spotty lacing as the beer is drained.

S: Cereal grain character, a light bready note, fresh cut hay, and a subtle hint of earthy spice. Pretty standard for the style.

T: Upfront, I get a light note of lemon quickly subsumed by some sweet grainy malt character with notes of bread crust. Mid palate I get some earth notes and a substantial presence of fresh cut hay. On the backend some nice noble hop spiciness comes in mixing with more earth and light notes of lemon. The finish has a nice spicy and earthy bitterness

F: Light bodied with high to medium-high carbonation. The mouthfeel is smooth and crisp with a bit of dryness on the finish. There is also a bit of minerality that comes in on the backend. That being said, the mouthfeel is a bit watery compared to other German examples of the style (e.g. Rothaus or Einbecker).

O: Very solid pils that is only average in the mouthfeel department, but hits the right notes in all other categories. Even at just under 5 months old this beer has held up very well and dare I say drinks better than many a new-wave American take on the style. Highly recommended whether you are on a budget or not!Mar 16, 2021"
Bitburger Premium Pils,4.25,4.25,4.0,4.0,"Pours a pretty gold with a little head and lacing. Smells of crackery malt, hops, some citrus.

I’ve had better pils and lagers, but this is decent and the price is right, cheers!Mar 13, 2021"
Bitburger Premium Pils,3.0,3.25,2.75,2.5,"L: Pours a very pale yellow/golden color, with a thin white head that leaves the glass fairly quick. Classic pilsner look.

T: The bread flavor is nice, slightly skunky, definitely has a straw aftertaste. 
F: High carbonation with a thin feeling to it, goes down smooth. 
O: A decent beer for it's style.Nov 28, 2020"
Bitburger Premium Pils,3.75,4.0,4.0,3.75,"My go-to German pilsner. At $5.99 4 pack of 16.9 oz cans, i's almost as good as another easily accessible German Pilsner in my area, Weihenstephaner Pilsner, which costs $12.99 for a six pack of 11.2 oz bottles. 

Nose: Hoppy, lemony, biscuit, white bread crust, unsalted crackers, some white pepper, hay, and faint grass notes.

Look: Classic pilsner, penty of bubbles streaming up, very light gold. Not yellow as a adjunct lager, but a light golden hue.

Taste Follows the nose. Sweet malts also come through.

Mouthfeel: Light with medium carbonation. Very clean and crisp. You can feel the German hops.

Overall: A winner. Not my favorite German Pilsner, as I tend to favor Jever, Rothaus Pils, and Weihenstephaner. But it's inexpensive, well crafted, and extremely enjoyable drinking.Nov 22, 2020"

Bitburger Premium Pils,4.0,4.0,4.25,4.0,"A - A nice bright gold that's more on the pale side, nice steady cascading carbonation, and a thin bright white layer of creamy white foam that sticks to the top of the beer and the glass.

S - Grassy, earthy citrus, slight herbal pepper spice, with a little shot of sweet honey malt. Overall aroma is crisp and crackery.

T - A sweet honey malt base lays a good foundation up front before a freight train of hops come sweeping in midway through. Sweet malt up front followed with assertive earthy citrus that builds all the way to the end and continues to do so even after the sip.

M - Big medium body with carbonated pricklies on the tongue and a bone dry finish. The earthy hops coat the sides of the mouth and creates a cotton-like sensation. 

O - This is just an all around beautiful Pilsner. It's been awhile since I've had it (not sure why I didn't review it), and just as good as I remember it.Nov 11, 2020"
Bitburger Premium Pils,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"TL:DR Better from the can 

~~Bottle Review~~

L: Golden and clear. Lacing quickly recedes leaving a most inactive beverage.

S: A bit skunky but plenty of light refreshing malt.

T: German Bud Light. (That's being nice to Bud Light.) A hint of woodiness from the Munich malt. It's decently bitter. Just a little more than enough to balance what would be sweet malt. Not much else going on here, it's pretty straightforward.

F: Very light on the palate. Easy to drink lots of.

O: Tastes fine and is plenty easy to drink. It's basic and won't steal the spotlight. Actually quite flavorful, but in a way that's conducive to having 3 or 4 pints easily.

~~Can Review~~

L: Same appearance except with more carbonation and a steady carbonation stream.

S: Earthy hops over buttery malts. No skunk this time.

T: Much better than the glass. I suspect the can protects the brew better. The malt is like a buttery biscuit. The hops are plenty bitter but not very aromatic (extract). There's a hint of Munich woodiness about it. Balanced and approachable.

F: Lingering bitterness but an otherwise dry refreshing finish.

O: Drinkable and okay. It's not the best, but far from the worst.Oct 17, 2020"

S- dry bread and roasted grainy malt aromas up front, followed by floral and spicy German hops.Earthy yeast balances it all out

T- sweet and malty up front, with toasted grains, followed by more sweet notes of honey. Mid-palate gives some spicy hops that add an elegant floral character. The finish gives some bready malt with more spicy hops and earthy yeast, lingers of toasted grains and honey

M- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that continues into a crisp, dry finish

Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and medium/strong carbonation.

A decent, if unremarkable PIlsner that starts out rather sweet, but turns a bit more dry and bitter in the finish.

von Trapp Brewing
Date: just a best before date 07 Sept 2021
I have five of these beers to consume tonight from this brewery. I have drunk the Dunkel it was good. This beer is 42 degrees, and I use a pilsner glass. The pour created a frothy and airy white head with okay retention. The head dissipation left some lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 4, pale straw with light golden hues. The clarity is clear, with a few carbonation bubbles visible. 

The aromas are light malty sweetness, subtle toasted crackers, light floral esters, and the faint aromas of bread yeast. 

The flavors are light malty sweetness, subtle toasted crackers, bready, floral esters, and every slight taste of green grass. 

The mouthfeel is crisp and a touch dry. 

The body of the beer is light, medium carbonation, and light finish. 

This beer is spectacular: the flavors are on point. I would go great with a summer evening watching the sunset after a long day at work.Sep 01, 2021"

Complex enough to match the others, but not quite as ""simple"" as the (still wonderful) Pilsner. It was the perfect combination of taste and refreshment. Deep golden color with nice bubbles and a decent pale yellow head; malty biscuit with a hint of hops in the nose, followed by a perfectly balanced flavor of malt and hops, and then a hint of bitterness at the end to cleanse the palate for the next taste. I loved it. And without the off-tastes you sometimes get from imports that have sat in bottles for months, it was perfect.Sep 23, 2020"

Pours into my shaker pint a clear golden with a bright white sudsy bubbly head and streams of bubbles ascending while the cap quickly drops to a ring and a film.

Scent is fruit (apples and pears), lemon, sweet doughy bread, floral

Taste follows the nose. Apple, pear, sweet doughy and bready malts and a faint hop note lending a crisp bitterness to the finish and a balance to the sweeter flavors. There's a soft lemon note. Some faint herbal hop notes. A mild metallic or mineral note which sounds off putting but is not.

Mouth is very slightly creamy and the carbonation is soft. Finish is clean with a light bitterness.

S: toasty grain and spicy-herbal hop; vibrancy mostly intact, but fading... bit of citrus (lemon tart); arguable floral and/or grapefruit rind notes

T: dry, doughy malt up front, followed by a surge of densely-packed, citrus-floral (noble?) hops... facets of the grain slowly emerge: mildly-acidic, toasty crust with kiss of honey-ish caramel rounding it out... pungent, herbal bitterness reasserts itself with each sip.. wondering if overall expression and depth has been dulled by age/handling

F: mildly spritzy from the onset, hop bitterness sharping its lively sting... rather dry finish; body lacks a little roundness, but doesn't feel flat... goes down fantastically easy, the bitter bite lights up the palate; moreish

O: very nice lager, vibrant flavors; relatively American-made in its overall character (similar to Jack's Abby, et al?)... obvious degradation in quality here, but the blemishes do not come close to ruining enjoyment... this was at least an introductory sampling, but I knew immediately I'd be getting a sixer soon enough (1655)Mar 22, 2020"

Victoria Bitter,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The WORST beer in the world! I am ashamed to be a Melbournian when it comes to this Vile Bile. I remember getting drunk on this turd-foam when I was 17 back in the late 80's. The beer scene in Melbourne was a lot cruder back then, and the variety was pretty abysmal. But hey, we were none the wiser. I discovered Coopers Red back in 1990, and never looked back. Glad to say that now, and just like everywhere else, we have a wonderful variety of beers that I would have died for back then. But - back to Vomit Bombs. I had the misfortune of drinking a Vermin Belch the other day, and I couldn't even finish it. It's like the recipe is - get some hops, bung it in a huge vat made of aluminum, wee into it, stir it around...and wait. About a day. Hey presto! the most pitiful beer every produced.Oct 01, 2021"
Victoria Bitter,3.0,2.75,3.25,3.5,"Victoria Bitter. VB. The Virus Beater. The Very Best. The Vomit Beer. Victor Bravos. There's almost as many analogies for Victoria Bitter, as litres of this stuff drunk on a daily basis. It's arguably Australia's most famous beer - piss off Fosters - and is certainly the most popular. There's hardly a pub where you can't find it either in tap or can/stubbie, and the words to the jingle are more well known than the lyrics to the national anthem (is it girt by sea, or gird by sea?) 

You either like VB, or you don't. There's no room for sitting on the fence with this beer. It's either something more sacred than holy water, or if your mum was on fire, you wouldn't even use it to try and extinguish her. I used to hate VB, I used to hate the bogan connotations that came with drinking this beer. I used to hate people who drank it. I was a downright snob, and used to look down on people who drank it - especially religiously. But my palate is diversifying, and let's give it a go, to see if I still hate it, or whether it's something that is at the very least tolerable. 

Look: This is going to be my 11th beer review, and all but 2 so far have been Aussie adjunct lagers. I will get to the better beers eventually. Poured into a pint glass, we've got a lovely honey gold liquid, clean, filtered. A thin finger of foam has accumulated at the top, but it didn't froth up. It's a little darker than your standard Aussie adjunct lagers, and it actually looks more appealing. 

Smell: The classic Aussie adjunct lager smell. Heavy earthy grassy notes come courtesy of the Pride of Ringwood hops, sweet pale malt, slightly sour. Am I overreacting by saying the sourness almost smells like Orange peel? I remember thinking it used to smell offensive. I no longer do. it just smells classically Australian. 

Taste: Malty sweetness, nice bitterness. Getting that grassy citrus peel flavour coming through on the bitterness. Smooth, easy drinking. Flavours are mellow, but prominent. Subtle sour tang with a dry finish that makes me want another sip. Slight adjunct taste but not overly powering. 

Feel: Fairly highly carbonated, which makes it convenient to slam down that ice cold beer. Ice Cold it is extremely refreshing. Body is medium, 

Overall; Either I've lowered my expectations, or I've diversified my palate, and I'm no longer a snob. I can't hate this beer any more. I'm not saying I necessarily love it, but I have grown to appreciate it. It's a part of Australian culture, and it's not going anywhere soon. It's certainly more drinkable than I remember it, and whilst I probably won't go buying slabs of this stuff, I certainly won't hesitate to go for it if I'm at the pub and there's nothing else worth drinking. 

Will say, the beer has to be drunk cold. Ice cold. You can't afford to let these warm up,. Once it's creeping up to room temperature, the bitterness from the hops seem to curdle and you get all sorts of nasty flavours going on. That's where I think most people go wrong with VB. It's simply not served cold enough. Most lagers should be ice cold, and ice cold is where the respectable flavours come out to play. Once it starts warming up, grab another one, or just drink em quicker.Aug 24, 2021"
Victoria Bitter,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,"04: (375 ml bottle, in Norway.) Sweetish orange-like aroma. The flavour is mostly bitterness - more than in Foster's and Castlemaine, but not really pleasant. Will not be a regular beer of mine this one.Jul 20, 2021"
Victoria Bitter,4.0,3.25,3.25,3.25,"Sure it's just another commercial lager, but with it comes good memories of a broke youngster partying at the local RSL, hence the higher score. One thing it has going for it (for an average to sh*tty lager) is that its slightly heavier in taste, not a totally watered down commercial lager as many are. Would I recommend it, probably not, but if you're in Oz, have a few just to blend in:)Jul 20, 2021"
Victoria Bitter,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,"This is my favorite beer after Satanic Chimp from Monkey Paw. I understand why so many people hate it, I just like that. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find it in the US. Maybe it's nostalgia for drunk port visits back in my navy days.

Victoria Bitter,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,"I've had it numerous times in pint glasses, stubbies, straight out of the can, even off the ground on one drunken evening. It tastes average at best regardless of what you do with it. It's a middle-class beer that's supposed to be pounded on a hot summer evening after a hard day's work in the trenches, or from your couch. 

The look is like any other dime-a-dozen lager, that classic piss-yellow tint. The smell has hints of alcohol and rice. The taste is well, I don't know; Like a Budweiser but with more tang. The feel is below average. Very carbonated and watery.Sep 12, 2020"
Victoria Bitter,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.25,"How is this beer like? Might be judged as poor overall but still does way better than the Euro Pale Lagers. Looks a bit darker in color than its American counterparts and has a faint smell (of apples?) but still okay. Its taste starts off as something clear, then takes a turn into strange malts or hops, who knows (again weird apples come into my mind) but still feels better than Coors Light. Then I read that it has added sugar, perhaps that's where this strange sweetness comes from! To sum it all up, it is not that bad overall (have been drinking Japanese adjuncts for weeks now celebrating the end of the year in 2017), even my wife seems to like it! It isn't a craft beer but it's not even supposed to be one. It is an okay American type lager, not great but nothing to complain about really.Jan 02, 2018"
Victoria Bitter,2.75,2.5,3.0,2.5,"Look - standard lemon yellow with high carbonation. no head.
Smell - biscuits and malts, not much else.
Taste - crisp but finishes with some sweetness that seems a bit out of place. not bad, but a bit peculiar.
Feel - light bodied, fairly watery, but easy to drink.
Overall - this is an adjunct lager inside out, but the sweetness gives it a distinct Aussie flavor that makes it different from other adjunct lagers. can't say i like it, but at least its unique in that way.Sep 29, 2017"

Victoria Bitter,1.25,1.25,1.25,1.0,"I spent 4 years of my life living in Australia, and was always surprised at why people liked this so much. This makes even Carlton draught seem nice..! At least Carlton Draught has some hoppiness!

However I was forced to drink this often, as a result of Aussies who regularly insisted on buying me a drink because of my ""accent"" and how drunk they always were! Haha...

This has a dryness and heaviness that makes it difficult to drink fast, and an overall flavor that is not really a flavor. It tastes like it has been pasteurised at 9000 centigrade for a year.

Beer in Australia is really expensive, Carlton and United must be making more money than Vegemite..

Had another recently in Bar Oz in Paris. Even compared with Euro lagers like Heineken and Carlsberg, this is even worse. Probably the worst beer I have had, it is really quite amazing how many Aussie hillbillies love the stuff. 

Yet it does bring back some good memories of watching crab racing in Sydney while backpacking...May 25, 2016"
Victoria Bitter,2.75,3.0,3.0,2.5,"Random bottle from random Aussie beer store. Not ad bad as rated previously by others, better than most of the Aussie pale lagers, but leans to the watery side.Jan 22, 2016"
Victoria Bitter,1.5,1.0,1.0,1.25,"from notes of 23/09/2015.

No head. No carbonation. No taste of beer whatsoever. Bad apple juice. Probably the worst beer of australia. Cant believe I earned an untappd badge for this.Jan 13, 2016"
Victoria Bitter,1.5,1.25,1.0,1.25,"I used to drink this stuff when I was backpacking in Australia. Well, that was a long time ago and I didn't really know any better. It was cheap!

I was passing a rather scruffy and noisy Australian-themed restaurant in Lan Kwai Fong, Hong Kong and the manager who I know called me in for a drink so I decided to have one of these for old times sake.

I poured a well chilled ""stubbie"" into a 350ml beer glass. Drank approximately half and thought better of it.

Poured a medium yellow with lots of loose carbonation. A thin, loose head disappeared almost immediately and left no lacing whatsoever.

Nose is that of a typically dreadful mass-produced adjunct lager; nasty. Faintly hoppy, metallic, no real complexity. Nothing in particular. 

Palate is much the same as the nose; metallic, chemical, slightly bitter and no complexity. Very bland.

Too much artificial carbonation and a light mouthfeel make it quite unpleasant.

Overall an overwhelmingly awful mass-produced lager. Perhaps if chilled to just above freezing on a very hot day with a real thirst on it could be enjoyed. But not by me. 

The only positive thing I can say about it, is that it's better than Carlton cold. But not much. It's absolutely terrible. 

Highly unrecommended.Jul 22, 2015"

Victoria Bitter,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.5,"Format: so I have finally done a review of VB. This is one of my mainstay standard 'drink while out because it is reasonable and well-priced' options, so take your pick - 375mL bottle, 375mL can, schooner, pint, whatever.

Appearance: pours out a dark amber colour with plenty of carbonation per the style. A one-finger white head hangs about for a time before dropping to a thick cap. Decent.

Aroma: the typical lager aromas of grains, some light grass hops and that's about it. A bit stronger than usual though.

Taste: there are some sweet malts here with a touch of sharp hops. That lasting bitterness for which the beer has been so long a favourite of so many.

Aftertaste: the bitterness lingers somewhat, but for the most part this is a beer to be drunk, not to be savoured.

Mouth feel: a light -to-moderate body with lots of lager carbonation. Brings the flavours forward, and most importantly is an amazing thirst quencher.

Overall: Though Victoria Bitter will probably never be considered one of the world's premium beers, the reason it has been so successful is that it has more flavour than most American Adjunct Lagers, something a bit different with that nice bitterness and is equally as reasonably priced. The final - and arguably most important - reason for its success is that it is one of the most thirst-slaking of Australia's warm-weather beers. a good all-rounder, and pretty hard to beat on value-for-money at AU$42 a case of 24 x 375mL.Dec 14, 2014"

Celis White,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this beer. With the recent closing of MBC's main facility, I'm glad I was able to pick up a bottle. Who knows what will happen to this fine brew?

Bottle etched (07/28/12)poured into a Hoegaarden hex glass.

A- Beautiful for the style. 1-finger white head sustains at a thin film throughout. The body was a hazy pale/straw color with moderate carbonation. A later yeast swirl adds to the haze/cloudy body. Really good stick left on the glass.

S- Nice and sweet. At first I imagine lifting the lid from the mash to inhale the wheaty goodness. Citrus, hints of peppery spice. Lemon becomes more prominent later.

T- Lovely and delicate. A solid dose of citrus (lemon/orange zest) and spice (grains of paradise, black pepper, corriander?). Black peppery without the bite. Malts are cracker-like. Clean finish.

M- Fairly light bodied. Lemony flavor helps to dry the finish.

O- Crisp and refreshing. Great summer beer. I can drink more than a couple in a sitting. The bonus is that I can share it with my wife.

I really hope somebody can continue with the recipe and name (especially locally). It's too good a back story to end with the closing of MBC's main brewery.Jun 17, 2012"

A- Light sweet aroma with lemon. There is a definite sour tartness.

T- Light sweet tart flavor. Light lemon and no noticeable corriander flavor. A bit light on flavor.

M- Light body and high carbonation. Very smooth drinking.

D- Pleasant beer, but a bit light on flavor. I am more partial to a heavy coriander flavor.Jun 05, 2012"

Well carbonated, some prickle on tongue.

Celis White,3.5,2.5,3.5,4.0,"Bottle date of 5/12/12.

Pours a murky yellow with a 1 inch foamy white head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, celery, lettuce, and spices. Definitely some weird aromas going on here. Taste is of grain, yeast, spices, and a very slight vegetal flavor but nothing like the smell. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer flavor wise but the aromas of leafy vegetables are definitely quite odd.Jun 01, 2012"
Celis White,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Poured into a nonic Imperial pint glass. Hazy pale yellow colored. 1” fluffy white head that recedes slowly leaving lacing on the sides of the glass.

The aromas include the wheat, some orange peel and a light bit of white pepper and coriander.

The flavors are similar to the nose with the orange peel and some light, spicy peppery. The wheat and malt have a bready sweetness that let the spiciness and a light bitterness show.

The mouthfeel is light and smooth with the active carbonation.

A nice, crisp refreshing beer.May 01, 2012"

M - Crisp medium mouthfeel.

O - Overall, this is a very nice, flavorful witbier. Very sessionable.Feb 27, 2012"
Celis White,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Celis White has a cloudy body that is somewhere between dull yellow and dull gold. The white head is large and solid looking, with a rocky top. The retention is solid, and ample lacing is left behind.

The aroma has a good bit of wheat to it, with notes of fruit and a hint of pepper. Pretty traditional and quite nice.

This beer is a well-made white. The wheat probably provides the most flavor for this one, with notes of bread and a little bit of twang. Orange and lemon both make an appearance, but without adding any sweetness. Coriander and general peppery flavors are more powerful in the flavor than the aroma. A hint of green apple comes through from the yeast in the finish.

Very smooth from the carbonation, with a substantial feel to the body.

This beer was left behind in my fridge after having some people over, so I didn't really have any expectations for it. I am glad that I tried it, because it turned out to be a well made witbier.Jan 29, 2012"
Celis White,4.0,4.5,4.0,3.5,"A: a very dull yellow hue. very cloudy, as they do. billowy bright white head sits on top. 

S: lemon, clove. there is a definite acidic smell here. maybe a little barny. there is an earthy and chalkyness from the yeast. 

T: similar to the nose, the acidity comes across the palate in the form of limes and lemons. there is a minor bready, malty backbone, but oh so light. a little bit of ginger. 

M: moderate amount of carbonation on one of the lightest bodies ive come across. 

D: super light body with a decent amount of flavor certainly makes this drinkable. the tart acidity is a nice touch. from what i understand, one of the classics in witbiers. glad a friend made me pick one up.Jan 27, 2012"

S - Orange, spice, a bit of sweetness and floral.

T - Slightly acidic at first then turns into sweetness (almost a little too sweet). Orange and spice quickly follow through. Once your tongue gets used to the sweetness, it becomes a little watery.

M - Light mouth feel with medium carbonation. Smooth and creamy. Very little detectable alcohol.

O - Very interesting beer. Maybe a touch too sweet, but overall a very nice drinkable beer. Good change of pace and will keep this in the fridge for the summer when it's hot outside.Nov 20, 2011"

Celis White,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,"Poured from the bottle into a Hoegarden style glass.

Appearance is pretty decent. Head is tight bubbled with a real small bubbled foamy white head. Body is a typical cloudy lemon yellow and gray, but the head leaves some minimal lacing and a decent puck throughout drinking.

Nose is distinctly buttery with a small wheat chew fairly pleasant but sort of faulty.

Taste is chewy sweet with a sugar sense. Palate texture feels solid and fine, but grain and wheat angle seems a bit burried. Citrus angle seems strangely artificial if not totally non existent.

Overall a mild buttery but also overly sweet Witbier that is missing wheat backbone and a citrus angle.Oct 14, 2011"

M-light-medium bodied, good amount of carbonation
O-great brew. I really liked the creaminess and amount of flavors in this beer while still keeping the body light and refreshing. None of the flavors outpowered the other and instead had a nice transition between each.Sep 17, 2011"
Celis White,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,"Grabbed a 6 pack of this at One for the Road in Wexford, PA, a few weeks back...

This didn't last long, but I managed to save the final bottle for review. This 12 ounce bottle has no freshness date, alas. Nevertheless, into my lovely Tripel Karmeliet glass it goes!

A. Purty! Huge, 3 inch white head is quite foamy and dies quick, leaving tons of succulent looking white lace... could hardly ask for better. The beer itself is a mildly unfiltered dull, bubbly yellow.

S. Bold. Really reminds me of La Fin Du Monde, minus that Unibroue yeast... loads of wheat, lemon, coriander, crisp honey-apple sweetness and just a hint of pepper. Classic and tight, nothing wrong here at all. Maybe a touch too sharp? But that's quibbling.

F. Classic Witbier here - honestly one of the best I've had from any country. Starts off thin (refreshing) and crisp, but not too sharp - the wheat softens it I think. Then a rush of gentle, yet insistent sweetness, tempered by a good dose of lemon-orange spritz. It is important to note that this is not really sour per se, nor acidic, but it does have that citrus and lingering sour finish. Otherwise, a good amount of coriander is present here, and a green apple ester (no apple sweetness) along with just a smudge of sulfur. The whole experience is drastically refreshing.

M / O. The finish on Celis White is soft, with an extremely long, lingering lemon-esque note and some white bread dough. The carbonation is equally soft / light, I personally would prefer a bit more... but that said, one could hardly ask for a better Belgian-style summer beer. This is both to style and excellent, and right up there with Allagash White for contention as the best Belgian Wit I've had out of my home country. In fact I feel like I prefer this to Allagash... guess I'd better acquire some more and find out, huh?Sep 01, 2011"
Celis White,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,"A- Pretty nice orange color that has alot of the white clear haze color to it. The head shows a 2 finger head, but a little too cola like.

S- Smells nice. It reminds me more of a tripel than a witbier. The coriander smell is strong, and the orange zest aroma you'd look a little bit for is not there.

T- Tastes nice though. It's a light tasting witbier, the orange flavor is there now, and the coriander is also there, but they go well together.

M- Super light bodied, making this an easy drinker.

O- It's super light folks, Sessionable all day long in the summer. Enjoyed this brew. probably a little lower on the calories too.Aug 29, 2011"
Celis White,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,"Pours light yellow, lemonade is a good comparison. Doesn't have the white that I'm used to - this is more of just a yellowish beer. Head is white, and disappears nearly immediately. Nose is faint and full of citrus and wheat.

Taste is good, light in citrus, a nice balance of wheat. Pretty standard white beer, no Hoegaarden or Allagash, but not bad. Mouthfeel is light and easy to drink.Aug 24, 2011"
Celis White,2.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,"Poured from bottle into a Sam Adams glass.

T - Tastes like a Belgian, some definite wheat notes. Nice and light.

M - Good. Smooth and not much carbonation.

Summary - This was a nice surprise, picked it up in a custom six pack from World Market and wasn't real sure what to expect. It's a good Summer brew and interesting enough to drink w/o food. I may pick up a six pack.Aug 02, 2011"

Bud Ice,2.75,2.0,1.25,2.0,"Yes, Bud Ice. The last time I had something with that name was back in 2007, when I tried and reviewed Bud Ice Light. That seems like half a lifetime ago. With it snowing yesterday in some low-laying area of the Southland for the first time since the 1940s, it feels appropriate to go for an ice beer. From a clear 12 ounce bottle, on to the beer:

The body is clean and nearly pale yellow with visible, lively bubbles running from bottom to top. The fizzy head drops to a wee lace above. Before I baptize into the liquid, I smell it. Someone took Budweiser and made the smell of fermented rice stronger, and added an odd steeley note to show that the two are different. Not quite Budweiser, and not quite malt liquor. 

The first sip is inoffensive with little to talk about. Once the liquid dries up, it reveals a nasty aftertaste that echoes, and leaves one of the worst aftertastes I've had in a beer. With small sips, I can somewhat tolerate it. With large sips, it pounds bitter seltzer water, cooked rice water, and fermentation that was rushed, giving the overall flavors an unfinished quality. It feels weak with a spritzy alcohol and a slightly syrup addition. 

I can tolerate a Budweiser, so I wonder where did Bud Ice go wrong? It's like the roast beef that was cooked at 500 degrees or a sportscar driving on a 4x4 track, I'm going to grab the whiskey after this and finally say that I tried Bud Ice.Feb 23, 2019"

Bud Ice,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.75,"Wow, for a more economic brew this beer packs some flavor and unique aromas. I am pleasantly surprised by this beers flavor profile as compared with many other beers that make competition. The looks is typical, light gold straw with carbonation bubbles and a thin cap. Some spotted lace in the glass. The smell is unique from my experience with many beers. This beer has a bubble gum like aroma along with sweet yeasty white bread notes. Very pleased with the nose. Taste is great for the value. Starts out yeasty and bready and turns into a light maltiness with a pretty dry finish there is not much in the way of hop character, seems to be all about the balance this is a very light tasting beer.there is no pungent off flavors no taste of adjuncts, just a solid all around American lager flavor. The feel is light to medium but is not watery. There is a low carbonation so the beer goes down very smoothly. Id say this beer makes a nice rotation beer or good all around beer to enjoy with a meal or at a party. Its economic and tastes pretty good.

Krombacher Weizen,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,"330 ml. bottle poured into a large snifter glass. I see this one as a curiosity but alas you never know unless you try. Pour is a standard hazy hue of wheat and with a decent cap of white foam.

Nose is predominantly of a yeast character though lacking in the banana/clove department. Slight lemon/orange note, otherwise a bright neutral wheaty character. Taste follows with more neutral notes and just a touch of wheaty banana on the finish. Light yeast character yet offers a soft wheat character on the palate which just a hint of spice. A different animal but well done in it's way.Jul 28, 2020"
Krombacher Weizen,4.0,2.0,3.5,4.0,"A - Poured into Weizen Glass. Brew appeared dark straw in color (very cloudy), sporting a nice two finger head (dissipating to one finger) with a normal pour. Brew is moderately carbonated, with minimal lacing. 

S - All notes seem very minimal and restrained. I detect much more citrus than banana, little spice to speak of, and no bubblegum notes. 

T - This brew is not the typical German Hefe I've always adored. This brew misses most of the prerequisite characteristics I cherish. There's little banana, little clove, and little if any spice. All that really comes through for me are the acidic citrus notes on both the frontend and the backend. In all honesty, it tastes watered down. I'm not at all thrilled.

M - Most of the time, there's a silver lining if one looks hard enough. Though this beer does seem watered down, I will say that the mouthfeel is very pleasant. There are no off putting or lingering flavors.

D - There's not much I can say about this offering other than I find it mediocre at best. If I was to compare it to other well known German Hefes, I don't think this brew would place very well, if at all. With that being said, this is in no way a terrible beer. In fact, it's much better than most wheat macros that plague store shelves. However, it still doesn't excuse this brews execution. All in all, it does have fine drinkability given its aforementioned qualities.Jan 25, 2020"
Krombacher Weizen,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Pours a cloudy, but not opaque, golden color. Two finger white velvety head collapses pretty quickly, but never completely. 

Aroma has notes of cloves, wheat, cinnamon, and a somewhat light hint of overly ripe banana. 

Taste has notes of clove and nutmeg, almost like a pumpkin pie spice mix coming through up front. The malts have some wheat in them, but there are also some caramely sweet malts that are overall more pronounced.

More hints of pear and white grapes. Some green apples in the mix. Some bread and crackers. The wheat comes through. Yeasts and malts do their thing. Alcohol goes unnoticed. Mouthfeel is nice. It's on the fuller side of light-bodied with moderate to active carbonation. It's extremely fluffy, slightly creamy, smooth and easy to drink.

$37.49/24 bottle case @ Javies Beverage, Philadelphia, PA 

Notes via stream of consciousness: Typical appearance with an orange body beneath a two-finger thick head of densely foamy white. Mild aroma with some banana and wheaty malt. The flavor follows with a bit of clove added in, and some mild tartness. It's not that bitter but there is some, and it's balanced nicely. This reminds me of many of the weizens that I've tasted in southern Germany, They're not the bigger, more flavorful examples like those from Ayinger, Paulaner, and Spaten, but they're popular because they're a little more accessible and drinkable. On a hot day in the biergarten one of these would go down nicely as the tartness is refreshing. Looking back, the head has dropped but it still maintains a full, creamy surface covering, and the lacing is pretty good - for a weizen it could be better. In the mouth it's medium-light and effervescently crisp with a very fine bubbled elevated carbonation. It only has a stiff bitterness to it but the carbonation helps to elevate that, and its tartness, and it finishes dry although a dollop of sweet malt lingers shortly. Overall it's not the best weizen I've had, nor is it really close, but neither is it the worst, it's actually far ahead. For the price I don't regret the purchase, although for about $6 more I could have moved up to a better brand. However, if you do the math that's an extra 16%. Given that I'll probably have a few parties this summer with people who aren't exactly connoisseurs I'll probably buy a few more cases of this, and some better stuff for myself!

Krombacher Weizen,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.25,"Pours a golden coloration with visible carbonation and a large, creamy head. Smells of banana and clove, with a hint of grain and citrus. Taste is a good balance of banana, clove and grain, with nothing standing out too much. There are hints of citrus and caramel malt as well, the latter lending a light sweetness to this which really isn't too bad though. Finishes with a very light bitterness. Sparkling mouthfeel with a light/medium body and lively carbonation.

This is nothing special, but a pretty solid Hefeweizen with a nicely balanced flavour profile. It's mainly let down by its relatively light body and slightly overdone carbonation. Still very drinkable on a hot day!May 18, 2018"

Appearance- Pours a golden yellow orange with a thick white head. Very hazy.

Smell- Grains, banana bread, clove.

Taste- Wheat based malt flavor up front. Turning more sweet, with a bready banana bread taste coming next. Sweetness lingers and blends with some bitterness into the finish. Flavor profile finishes with a bit of clove and wheat.

Mouthfeel- Thin/medium with active carbonation.

Krombacher Weizen,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,"My family bought two crates of this Weizenbier because it was on sale in Germany.
When poured into a glass it looks like a typical Weizenbier, with a golden orange colour.

Krombacher Weizen,4.0,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Pint served in a proper hefeweizen glass at the restaurant I ate lunch at today. On tap and served with an orange wedge (yuck)

Appearance - Hazy and rich golden and orange colored beer. Impressive two and a half fingers of frothy white head with above average retention and lots of lace. Hefeweizens may be the most beautiful beer in the world when served properly into fine glassware.

Smell - Banana and clove as per usual. A little heavier on the banana than most. General wheat backing adds something. 

Taste - A little thinner than some, while quite refreshing, this weizen didn't have the magic of others. Banana is steady and the clove a little underdone here making it a touch to sweet. 

Mouthfeel - Smooth and light with a somewhat dense feel and middling carbonation.

Overall - A good but not great hefeweizen that I'm happy to have tried nonetheless.Jun 23, 2017"

Certainly looks legit..apricot colour, cloudy, etc.

Hints of banana and clove..and that distinctive sweet Krombacher malt

sadly the aforementioned malt tends to dominate things..the weizen elements fight a losing battle here

Fuller body than most German examples, perhaps due to the syrupy sweetness that dominates things

Certainly not worth the price I paid...pass next timeJan 07, 2016"
Krombacher Weizen,3.75,3.75,3.5,4.0,"Looks like a typical Weizen: dark golden/light orange with a nice head of foam. Not a lot of carb visible on the outside. A nice Weizen nose of clove, which continues in the taste. The taste also has a little sourness (lemon?) in it, and the sweeter fruits like banana i tend to associate with Weizeners appear to be lacking completely.

Krombacher Weizen,3.75,2.5,2.5,3.0,"Bought a 500ml bottle from one of the discount food stores in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong selling mainly imported European, Japanese and Korean products for HKD18. Poured into a wheatbeer glass. 

Poured a cloudy orange/light brown with a couple of inches of tight to medium head that lasted well. Not much lacing. Looks well carbonated with streams of bubbles rising to the top of the glass.

The nose was a little bit disappointing; some orange, honey, very light spice and a weird plasticky/rubbery aroma. 

Well-rounded malts, some fruit and a small amount of spice but the palate is a little bland for the style. No real bitterness.

Mouth feels nice. Carbonation is very light, despite looking otherwise.

Overall I was slightly disappointed with Krombacher. I've drank quite a few german beers in the hefewiezen style and this one didn't match up. Compared to Franziskaner, Weihenstephan et al it's rather bland and the nose is a little off-putting.

No visible bottle or import date.

Appearance: The beer has near crystal clarity. It has a brilliant gold colored body with a fluffy white head. Very good retention and lacing.

Aroma: There is a faint skunky aroma and a note of cereal grains. A slightly spicy, noble hop aroma surfaces and dominates the nose just over the cereal grain scent.

Taste: Up front there is a light spicy hop flavor with a light bit of sweet caramel character, mixed in with sweet corn. The flavor profile is consistent throughout drinking, and it has just a hint of bitter root at the back end.

Mouthfeel: It is light bodied and easy to drink. Carbonation feels good.

Overall: It is an easy drinking beer that is flavorful and a bit sweet. The label states ""SUPER BOCK"" but the beer is closer to a lighter Vienna Lager.

Super Bock,2.5,3.0,2.75,2.25,"So, I'm reviewing this beer (scorewise) as a Lager, which is the style listed here. That said, this has Bock elements, but....well it's not a Bock.

Appearance: Golden yellow that has a slight touch of bronze as it's cast away from the light. Produced a finger and a half of head that immediately evapourated. Body is clear with steady slow carbonation. This alone pretty much cements that this is not a Bock, and if it was, it would be the lightest Bock of all time.

Smell: Well it does get this a bit right, as toffee malt is the dominate note, but it's battling a bit of a mixture of wet grass and straw. It's like the lager wants to overcome the Bock-like malt, but can't quite do it. That wet note also could be a slight touch of skunk. Touch of earth as well. Warming doesn't help its case much.

Taste: Starts with a very weak caramel malt that then gets overrun by straw, corn and a slight earth touch. It's like taking the mask off a scooby doo villian here. ""Let's see who this Bock really is! (GASP) Old man macro lager!"" That said...it's not bad in that regard, it just doesn't work with the initial flavour.

Mouthfeel: The transitioning here is awful, because it takes that right turn on the malt, completely needlessly. If you were going to do it, I would presume you end with sweet, not start with it, but whatever. Aftertaste is an inoffensive mild straw and earth note. Carbonation also doesn't seem quite right either, as it dies down half way through the beer and only helps the straw portion.

Drinkability: It's refreshing and light bodied, I'll give it that but because it has that sweet note at the start, it kind of disqualifies itself from the guzzler category of lager. Still it's somewhat crisp and I think I can see one instance where this would be good. 

Final Thoughts: I've been to a Portuguese restaurant once before, and it tends to be fish, but not shell fish dominant. This beer I can see going well with mild fish and that tomato rice they serve. That's really it, and at a restaurant like that, I'd be more inclined towards wine. I guess that's why it is the way it is. A Super Bock though this is not, it's passable lager.Nov 29, 2019"

Smell : Initial smell is bad but not too bad , corny , sweet , can actually smell a little bit of grassy malt in there.

Taste : What is there to say really , it lacks taste , which i guess is what the selling point of a beer like this is. There's a little sweetness , but those hops really don't come through on the taste unfortunately, a little buicuity malt there.

Feel : Clean and smooth i suppose , moderately carbonated. Fine.

Overall : Well , it ain't super , and it sure ain't a bock , but i suppose if it's served as close to its freezing point as possible , and if you're eating some food , it's fine.

I've already been invited to stay at his house in Portugal. Why would I want to go to Portugal? I wouldn't go to Portugal to throw up which I might have to do after having drunk this sewage. He gave Precious a six pack of this mule piss and asked her to bring it to me.

So Precious put it in the fridge. I went to check it out. Super Bock. Dang! That must be pretty powerful stuff. But it's not bock, and it's not super. It's just a lager, and it's not that good either. It tastes almost as good as Meister Brau but at three times the price. It's similar to the bargain budget American light lagers.

Super Bock,3.75,3.25,3.5,4.25,"Every country has what we can call its ""normal"" beer. For Portugal, it's Super Bock. The beer we drink accompanying food, be French fries, grilled fish or - this is when Super Bock becomes mandatory - the hyper-caloric cardiovascular-disease-inducing Francesinha. 
Super Bock, contrary to what its name implies, is not a Bock but a Lager, and a relatively light and pale one. I don't like to describe beers in regard of the smell AND/OR taste, as both are too dependant on each other, but rather in terms of the combination of both - the AROMA. And if you consider this, you will understand why this beer has been rather overlooked by many of my fellow reviewers. 
The first impression is of a very standard lager in the way it pours and the formation of foam. A slightly golden straw-like colour and a light foaming head with a very faint smell of malt with some notes of corn. Aromatically, some caramel is present in the combination of the sweetness of the malt and the aforementioned corn notes. Second taste is somewhat a bready one, but a slight bitterness starts to appear, which becomes present in the aftertaste, revealing the presence of the hops. Not having a very stressed aroma, this makes this beer a perfect one to have with your meals. It is refreshing without being too light on ethanol, it is aromatic without being too intrusive, it combines well with everything you put in your mouth.
Having lived in Belgium for some time, this beer competes, in terms of quality and aroma, with the plain Belgian mass-production beers like Artois and Jupiler, and deserves much more appreciation.

It's interesting that this has nothing to do with Bock beer, despite the name. But it's actually a better than average lager, not too pale and it does have some flavor. More importantly it doesn't taste bad! From the supermarket in Bray-sur-Seine, France.Jul 12, 2018"
Super Bock,2.75,2.5,3.0,2.75,"This style does not get much love (whether you consider it Adjunct or Malt Liquor.)
But when someone makes the effort to import from Portugal and the beer gets put in a largely despised American style, it still seems to me that it is fair play to have an open mind.
In this case, Super Bock was selected to pair with the food of a pan-Asian restaurant inspired by Portugal's former colony of Macao. The menu was more thoughtful than the beer list. I selected Super Bock as I'd never rated a beer from Unicer.

A slightly below average beer in Looks, Smell and Feel. Taste I consider to be average, sweet malt balanced by enough hops.

Sweet bready malts on the tip of the tongue with very pronounced esters manifesting in banana and bubble gum. The clove is nearly absent here, and the wheat that was so present on the nose is also pretty restrained. As a result, it skews a little sweet.

Medium-light bodied. Spicy yeast is really present as a ""feel"" more than a flavor, and uniquely so, lending excellent drinkability.

Paulaner Hefe Weissbier,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,"From the bottom of the can: ""09.21.2021 3 09.21.2020 D""

The can states that this is a ""Hefe-Weizen Munich Wheat Beer""

Appearance: The body is an orange-gold color that is very hazy. It is nearly opaque but very stretched out and fuzzy shadows are visible through the hazy body. There is a lot of visible carbonation. The head is very large, even when care is taken while pouring. The head has a massive cloud-like appearance with a surface that looks like whipped cream. Head retention is fantastic and it leaves great lacing on the glass.

Aroma: There are aromas of lemon and white pepper with a bit of bay leaf. A mellow hint of clove comes through. After a while an interesting tortilla aroma was coming through.

Taste: Up front there is a light banana flavor mixed with a hint of clove. As it passes towards the middle of the tongue a light cream of wheat character comes through with a hint of vanilla. A very light yeast flavor is present which gives the beer a very light dough flavor. Towards the back of the mouth there is a light herbal flavor which tastes a bit like bay leaf, and at times a slightly astringent cedar wood.

Mouthfeel: It is medium-full bodied with a nice thick presence on the tongue. There is only a very mild bitterness on the back corners of the tongue in the aftertaste. It is very easy to drink and it is refreshing.

Overall: It is a very rewarding and uplifting beer to drink with a fantastic appearance, a pleasant aroma, and an enjoyable flavor profile. The beer has a nice broad palette of characters that it delivers to the senses, and that is what makes it so enjoyable. All these characters are brought to the senses very elegantly and delicately. It's hard to tell exactly, but judging by the two dates on the can it looks like I am consuming it at the mid-point between the two (canning date and expiration?). As an import beer, in a can specifically, I would recommend it at least at the 6 month or half-way point listed on the can. I would definitely drink this again.Feb 19, 2021"

It’s the #1 wheat beer in Germany and one of the world’s favorites. In fact, beer experts call it a masterpiece. In developing this beer, the Paulaner brewmasters have perfected a unique technique with “yeast suspension,” resulting in a uniform, slightly cloudy appearance, consistent quality, and perfect taste.

Appearance - Pours a cloudy gold with five fingers of frothy moussy white head.

Smell - noble earthy and leafy hops, bubblegum aromas, clove, pepper, banana, bready and grainy malts, and earthy yeast.

Taste - noble earthy and leafy hops upfront. The bubblegum aromas, clove, pepper, and banana follow suit and are nicely balanced. The bready/grainy malts and earthy yeast round out the brew. 

Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes creamy with all elements lingering. 

Overall - A pleasant hefe from the true source of wheat beers. It's nice to see how well this brew can stand up to some of the best hefe's made by several craft breweries. A nice treat to find here in Cowtown!Sep 27, 2020"

Erdinger Weissbier,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,"The bottle boasts that this is the world's most popular Weissbier. Could that be simply because it's readily available? For some reason this guy and Paulaner are the two German Weissbiers that are always in stock at local liquor stores, except maybe the discount ones in the bad parts of town. Otherwise, I can't see why it would be the most popular. Maybe people buy it because they see that it's Bavarian, read the import price tag, and assume it must be good. I know I did the first time I bought it. Not that there's anything offensive about this beer, it's just not as good as I hoped. Anyway, here's the review.

Poured from a bottle into a Weissbier glass. Foamy, three finger head, tons of carbonation, seems like even more carbonation than you'd expect from a Weissbier. (I defy you to swig this without belching). Let the carbonation settle a bit, the head sticks around 5 minutes later.
Smell - mild. I don't know that in a blind smell test I could tell it's a Weissbier. Mild, hint of yeast, maybe a tiny hint of the typical banana, or maybe I'm just anticipating it- it's that mild. And on the back end a hint of what I can only describe as ""bottle depot"".
Taste - I hesitate to say bland... it's mild, put it that way. Up front, totally inoffensive, but you'd never guess it's a Bavarian. Tiniest hint of clove on the back end, next to no fruit/banana taste you get with most Weissbiers. Aftertaste brings more of that ""bottle depot"" taste, but not in a particularly offensive way.
Feel - smooth, except for the carbonation. I advise you to let this one simmer down a little before quaffing.
Overall - not a bad beer by any means, but not worth the premium price either. In fact, every single other German Weissbier I've tried was better. I would only recommend Erdinger to maybe someone who swears by light lagers, just to get them to branch out into a different style without scaring them off. But honestly, I'd probably just pick something better for that.Aug 11, 2021"
Erdinger Weissbier,2.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,"500 ml can poured into a nonic pint glass. Pours a hazy straw yellow with a quickly fading head and not much lacing. Kind of disappointing for a hefeweizen.

Erdinger Weissbier,4.5,3.75,3.75,4.0,"Look: Pours a cloudy medium yellow with hints of orange. The head is bright white and soft, topping out around 1 1/2 fingers. After 5 minutes the head has dissapated slowly and sits at a 1/3 finger of covering across the glass.

Smell: Hints of lemon, mixed with clove and spring breeze. Floral but delicately so. Touches of banana and dough.

Taste: Cloves and banana. Soft and round and quite well balenced. Very smooth and subtle. Nothing about this beer packs a wollup, everything is about balence and proportion. 

Feel: Light/Medium bodied, smooth and silky with a round finish. 

This beer is a strong B+. Are there better German Hefe-Weizen's, yes.....but this is a perfectly good substitute for a relaxing summer afternoon.Jun 25, 2021"
Erdinger Weissbier,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.25,"Pours a slightly cloudy, deep golden coloration with a medium, frothy head and slightly visible carbonation. Smells of doughy malt, grassy hops and hints of spicy yeast esters, as well as a certain mineral note. Taste is a decent balance of sweet'ish doughy malt, very light spicy/fruity yeast esters of banana and clove, as well as some bitter, grassy hops and a certain mineral note also coming through. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some grassy hops, hints of clove and that certain mineral note lingering in the aftertaste. Soft mouthfeel with a light/medium body and medium/strong carbonation.

This Hefeweizen is seriously lacking in that typical estery yeast character to me, while it also feels somewhat light-bodied and over-carbonated, despite a decent, soft mouthfeel. While some clove is noticeable, there very little banana to be found here, with the flavor profile being dominated by rather sweet malt and grassy hops, as well as a certain minerality. The balance just doesn't work out at all for me here, with this being quite sweet despite lacking in a rich maltiness, the yeast esters being way too weak here, while the grassy, mineral notes are too pronounced for my personal taste. One of the worst Hefeweizens I've ever had, to be honest.Jun 19, 2021"
Erdinger Weissbier,3.75,3.25,3.25,3.25,"On tap and from bottle, on numerous occasions. A refreshing and crisp summer beer. However, my initial admiration for this beer has been somewhat lowered, after finding other weissbiers with more flavour.Apr 20, 2021"
Erdinger Weissbier,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Erdinger Weissbier is delicately hazy and a pale amber in color with hints of nectarine jam. The head is cloudy, bone white, and lasting.
The aroma starts off delicate and yeasty, with an underlying presence of bread dough. The aroma of banana blends easily with those notes of yeast and bread. Sadly though, there is no presence of clove which you would expect from a beer of this type. The finish is delicate and only very slightly grassy in nature.
Flavor starts off with an almost citrusy tartness, something reminiscent of Seville oranges, maybe. Flavors of yeast and fresh baked bread come through at this point. As with the nose, this is where I find flavors of banana blending seamlessly with that yeasty, fresh baked bread. Carbonation is soft and spritzy, helping highlight this beer’s delicate flavors. The finish is only slightly grassy, before fading into the background.
It would be all too easy to describe this weissbier as being bland, or lacking in character. I think it’s more apt to describe it as delicate, maybe a good introduction level weissbier. This might be a classic example of a beer to give someone who’s never had this kind of beer before.Apr 20, 2021"

Very fresh aromas sourdough bread and spices.

The bottle states this is the ""World's No. 1 Hefe-Weizen."" While that may simply be marketing hyperbole, the overall mild, inoffensive flavor may very well make it so. That is not to say it is forgettable, only that in the world of fine German wheat ales, it falls toward the bottom. Tangy, yeasty and refreshing, it has the hallmarks of the style without the subtlety of cloves and bubble gum flavors I have come to expect.

India Pale Ale,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.5,"A simple 1F soft off white head forms upon pouring from a can into a tulip glass. Streaky lace forms as you drink and the color is a nice gold at about 90% transparency.

The aroma is mild with some citrus notes and a bit of earthy roasted grain.

Taste starts with a dark hop forward light bitterness and then a smooth light malt fullness on the sides of the tongue. The hop note reminds me of lightly charred grapefruit pith, that has just a bit of mild astringency as it lingers. The malt is not sweet and seems to be there to add body and to tame the hops a bit. Definitely a hop forward balance, but not too bitter and not piney.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Carbonation is just a bit tangy and helps cut the mild astringent hop bitterness but it still leaves a residual thickness after the taste.

I was expecting a bit more dankness based on their description. It is a nice IPA that finishes just a bit thick for me. Overall a good beer, but it may not make it into my rotation as I am finding my palate more attracted to a bit more malt.

India Pale Ale,4.5,4.0,4.25,4.0,"Poured from a 12 oz CAN into a pub glass

Pours an excellent clear amber color with a spectacular, three-finger, rocky, foamy almost pure-white head with great staying power. Outstanding-looking beer.

The aroma is well balanced, with a solid malt foundation balanced with a ruby-red grapefruit tartness and a hint of piney goodness. Hoppy, but in a fresh balanced way. The aroma is rather muted, but well done.

The flavor is also a great study in balance and nuance. The backbone is malt, not bitterness, but the hops arrive as solid, not aggressive, and juicy, not piney. 

The mouthfeel is solid but maybe a shade disappointing compared to some other aspects of the brew--considering how spectacular the head and retention were, the carbonation might be just a shade lacking. Still, it finishes nice and crisp.

Overall, this is a well-balanced IPA. Hop heads will revile it as too mild, but it's the way an IPA really should be--hoppy without trying to register triple digits on the IBU scale.Nov 25, 2017"

it is very enjoyable and refreshing this beer on a hot summers day but if this beer warms up its gonna suck and you are not going to like it .
I recommend drinking it ice cold with a little lime .
overall a good beer if you drink it ice cold .

It is a bit pricey for what it is but on a hot day or night it's refreshing especially after being in the freezer for a bit.

Corona Extra,4.5,4.25,4.75,4.75,"Love this beer. So refreshing especially in the summer here in Vegas. Adding a lime gives it a nice touch. Amazing how this beer is hated by a lot but that's only because it's from people that love ipa beers. I'm not gonna bash an ipa because I can't stand the bitterness.

Corona Extra,2.5,3.25,3.25,2.75,"This is a 120z. bottle poured into my Corona pint glass. This is a clear straw color with very little white foam. The carbonation is steady but light. The foam has completely disappeared after a minute. 
There is a mild sweet malty aroma, typical of a lager. 
The taste is bread, there is light corn sweetness, finishing slightly bitter. 
The feel is a light mouthfeel, watery, typical of the style.
This is a beer I enjoy after doing yard work when it is hot or it is a vacation beer when south of the border maybe on a Caribbean Island. With or without a lime this beer is OK. Corona has it's own unique flavor and I like it best when I am very thirsty.May 10, 2021"
Corona Extra,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0," oz. clear bottle with a BB of Oct 2021 (sampled May 2021).

Appearance: Clear pale straw body, no head.

Aroma: Mild malt sweetness, corn, and a fair bit of skunk.

Taste: Same as it smells, mild yeasty note, classic lager profile.

Mouthfeel: Medium low body, medium high carbonation, clean finish.

Overall: It's Corona! Pretty classic adjunct lager brew, not much flavor, not much expected. A squeeze of lime and it's easy drinking. About as far from Craft Beer as you can get, so I understand the low scores, but there is nothing wrong here. Pretty perfect for a Cinco De Mayo or a day on the beach or in the hot sun.

First time I had this was at my mate Barry's family BBQ, the wife hated it she was having a shit day, the kids were being annoying but not my problem. One sip in and I was transported to el barrio. I couldn't even hear the Mrs moaning, I was in pure bliss.

The bottle alone is a sexy silhouette that lures you in. The slightly sweet taste captures you and needs you wanting another sip. Needs to be served cold with a slice of lime but I make sure I always have shelf full in my fridge, sorry kids, this is the beer shelf only, none of your frubes in here lol.

It's not a good beer. Not terrible, but just not something to brag about. It's never the same taste when you grab a sixer of these. You might get a set that's maybe enjoyable or you get a set that smells straight up skunky. If you find a decent set the taste isn't bad, real light feel and can go down easy.

That time this Premium Malts seemed to top the line, but now after a year having had it again was a bit disappointed.
It is somehow light and tasteless but perhaps this is how German beers should be. Otherwise it is clear, clean and easy to drink, mild and drinkable for everyone. Still way better than Euro Lagers.May 14, 2017"
Suntory The Premium Malt's,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,"An intriguing one I found at my local Genko Mart on “quick sale”: Suntory The Premium Malt's. So “yet another Japanese take on a German/Czech Pilsner...” I hear you moan. Yes, I can hear you, I’m monitoring you right now and can see where your hand is... you know you shouldn’t touch it all the time - you’ll wear it out... [your 2015 Pfizer annual general practitioner conference stress ball that is]... the question of where the cameras are hidden aside [remember that potted plant you didn’t buy], Suntory don’t have the best reputation when it comes to beer, however I noticed I haven’t tried a single one of theirs yet - let’s give ‘em a shot Doc. What’s the worst that could happen? The apocalypse? Perhaps [LOOK OUT!!!].

Poured from a 334ml bottle into a Sapporo (Ooo, sacrilegious!) stein.

A: Hazed golden body with a thin white lace ring... it sorta didn’t even manage to conjure up a head... bit disappointed with that rather lackadaisical effort from a Japanese Lager... perhaps it was the Sapporo glass? You should never cross the streams (or the glasses) it would seem. 5/10.

S: Toffee/caramel malt forward with a light floral note towards the back. An almost Fuggles (hop) earthiness lingers around too, is this a Lager or an Ale? The aroma itself is confused as to the answer. Without a doubt one of the weirdest Pilsners that I’ve ever sniffed, and I’ve sniffed a Pilsner or three over the years. 6/10.

T: Floral, minty hop notes mingle with grainy/earthy malts, some toffee sweetness and a hint of ume plum sourness... yes, this is quite a mixed bag of flavours from a Japanese Pilsner, however it goes down alright. Finish is less dry/crisp and more grassy bitter than most other Japanese Lagers out there. I get the general impression that this 5.5% ABV Pilsner doesn’t like to be trifled with... bit of warmth in the aftertaste as well. 7/10.

M: Surprisingly gassy carbonation given the non-existent head. Mid to light bodied, bit of chewiness in there as well. 6/10.

D: What an odd fellow this beer is - it reminded me of a clash of cultures, like a proper English gentleman from the Victorian era with a handlebar moustache, meerschaum pipe and stovepipe hat, who also wears a kimono and practices kendo in the evenings... an odd mix, that works in an odd way, and is oddly good. Which makes this Suntory one of the best Japanese Macro Lagers I’ve had (plus it isn’t brewed here under licence). 7/10.

Nose isn't too bad, toasted pilsner malts, grainy, little husky, doughy malts, little mineral note to the lagering, little raw dough, into mild grassy noble hops, hint of fruity lager esters. 

Taste is dry, a little crisp, incredibly dry somehow, like chewing on hay, a little straw, toasted pilsner malts, very husky and dried grains, little raw dough again, grainy pilsner, with mild fruity lager flavors again, into a very mild grassy hop. Hint of mineral note. Finish again dry, very quick finish, clean crisp, no real bitterness but a little mineral weird lager taste late.

Suntory The Premium Malt's,3.75,3.0,3.0,3.5,"classic yellow beer here, except i get no off flavors, none of that corn syrup thing, and a pretty solid mouthfeel actually, with lots of carbonation and a very clean finish. bright and bubbly looking sunny colored brew, inch of white foamy head, and for what i assume to be a budget beer in japan, it looks awfully good. fresh grain, a little sweet, pale barley and light crystal malt in this one, with basically no hops. its refreshing because of the feel, but has that mild sweetness throughout. this is the kind of beer that goes good from the can after yard work, or with a spicy fish dinner, just clean refreshing beer that cuts through some big flavors when it is asked to do so. in the american craft beer context its sub par, but in the international lager type world, its ahead of many of its peers. cool to try bu i wouldnt buy it here.May 21, 2014"

M: It feels a little more than light-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation. The finish leaves your mouth a little dry.

S: Moderate aromas of grainy malts with lighter amounts of adjunct malts (grains) that give sweetness to the smell. Slight notes of earthy hops.

T: The beer starts out with some grainy malts combined with a little bit of adjunct grain malts that contribute a touch of sweetness. Very light amounts of earthy hop flavors. Light to moderate amounts of bitterness in the finish that lingers..

Suntory The Premium Malt's,2.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,"Damn you form timeout! You cost me this review. Anyways, this might be a bit brief as a result, as I had to retype it. I got this one from a buddy who came home from Japan.

Appearance: Poured with barely a single layer of carbonated bubbles that vanished almost immediately and didn't lace. The body is a standard gold lager colour with slow carbonation.

Smell: Citrus hops and Water Chestnut to a backing of fairly plain grain. Nothing too special here, and could be a bit stronger.

Taste: Starts with a mild malt with a grainy taste that turns right into a hit of earthy and citrus hops. Doesn't dance around, gets right to the point and does it well. 

Mouthfeel: Crisp and clean with a nice mild hop aftertaste. Surprisingly good carbonation. Could be a bit gentler transitioning and a lack of frothy head always grinds my gears.

Drinkability: Light, refreshing but interesting. I dunno if I'd want to drink it all night, but it's smooth and crisp like a pilsener should be.

Final Thoughts: The right blend of Japanese and German brewing. I wouldn't say it's world shatterer, but all in all it's well done. It's kinda sad, because it's a good beer but not so good that it would likely justify the import costs. Oh well, give it a shot.Apr 07, 2012"
Suntory The Premium Malt's,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,"Had this on tap recently at Gatten Sushi in Iruma, Saitama, Japan. Amazingly different from the can... a much thicker white head with a beautiful thickness that lingers in the mouth like marshmallow. The flavor of the hops comes through much clearer from the tap as well, greatly improving on the taste in general. Overall, on tap, this might be my favorite standard brew in Japan, and I would definitely recommend it if you can find it on tap.

[Can Review - 3.35] This is one of my normal beers I drink by the can here in Japan. A beautiful golden brew with a nice bubbly white head that leaves a bit of random lacing. The smell is a bit sour sometimes, especially coming from a can, but this is different from bottles. A wonderful taste with lots of hops and even some caramel. However, this is a gassy gassy canned beer. Every swallow is immediately followed by a burp. Less than attractive and unnecessary. A little Barney from the Simpsons. I wish this weren't the case in the canned brew, but it is, so I have to judge this review on that. Overall, this is a tasty beer that goes well with most Japanese foods (especially with spicy Korean -- amazingly well!)Mar 02, 2012"
Suntory The Premium Malt's,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,"Coming in a 500ml can, produced in 07/2011, BB 03/2012, served chilled in a slim pilsner glass. Notes: the beer not only uses 100% Aroma Hops, 100% Malts, but also comes “unpasteurised”, according to the info. printed on the can.

A: light straw in colour, coming with lively yet smooth flows of tiny & medium bubbles, topped with a lasting thin off-white foamy head.
S: the nose is full of “Aroma Hop” as specified on the beer label, with traces of apple-ly aromatic notes plus sweet peach-blossom hints, possibly rendered by Saaz hops (in fact this aroma reminds me of several lower-abv. Czech pivo tasted on tap in that country); a good body of lager malts with smooth sweetness stays underneath, with a very mild edge of doughy sourness in the remote corner. Altogether the nose is balanced and aromatic, pretty enjoyable.
T: the entry is sour-sweet malty, pleasantly fruity with hints of peach blossom, with bitterness ensuing seamlessly behind; the middle settles with more hop bitterness at its medium level, while malt’s residual “adouki bean-ish” mashy notes and bitter-nutty notes reveal themselves in the aftertaste. The lightly spicy finish is rounded yet clean, not very bitter or dry, and yet never cloying.
M&D: despite the low serving temperature, the fizziness feels rather smooth on the palate, while the body remains at the medium level throughout the drink. All in all, I find this balanced lager beer a rare, refreshing treat after tasting quite a few mass-produced lagers from Japan. The “All Malts” definitely is the better idea for lager-making, I hope the brewery also agrees! I can’t seem to agree on this beer’s designated style here, which I personally would describe as Czech Pilsner or Czech Svetlo Pivo, but it doesn’t matter as the beer tastes pretty nice anyway.

B.H. reminds me that in the UK, they are called ""tins"", but he still does not care for them.

From the CAN: ""Esteemed quality with fine barley malt, aroma hop and natural water."" Also, lots of Kanji, which I CANnot read.

The Crack & Glug presented the legendary Stone ""fizzy yellow beer"" - two fingers of rocky bone-white head exploding itself out of existence above fizzy golden-yellow beer with NE-quality clarity. The nose was solid - a biscuit malt light sweetness underlain with a grassy hoppiness. It is when I come across well made beers in a CAN that this all seems worthwhile (as opposed to those last two clunkers). Mouthfeel was medium with a more grassy than malty taste on the tongue, despite its name. Finish was dry, crisp, grassy and simply very flavorful.

Primator Weizenbier,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"00 ml bottle into weizen glass, no bottle dating. Pours hazy golden yellow color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big lemon, orange, pear, banana, bubblegum, clove, coriander, wheat, bread, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and light earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big lemon, orange, pear, banana, bubblegum, clove, coriander, wheat, bread, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Light herbal bitterness, yeast spice, and wheat tang on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange, banana, bubblegum, clove, coriander, wheat, bread, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitter/spiciness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately creamy/grainy mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5%. Overall this is an excellent hefeweizen! All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink. A very enjoyable offering.Dec 04, 2016"

Primator Weizenbier,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"0ml bottle poured into a weizen glass.

Cloudy orange amber color with very thick creamy white head that stays with great retention, it slowly subsides to everlasting foamy crown along with lots of sticky lacing, high visible carbonation.

The aroma is all what you can expect from German’s Hefeweizen; clove forwards, then bubble gum, some spice, banana, citrus, some yeasty tartness, and bready malt.

Sweetness sweeps all over with a quality of bready malt, yeast is not going anywhere but thereafter takes over the palate by a note of banana ester together with clove spiciness and mild tartness. Hop is traditionally muted with just very slight bitterness undertone.

Medium body, smooth mouthfeel and soft effervescence flow through the palate from some lively carbonation, quite refreshing, dry finish.

Hefeweizen from Czech Republic, and I must say yes it is straight to the point. Truly like German’s brew and perhaps better in some case.Aug 19, 2016"

Primator Weizenbier,3.5,3.75,4.0,3.75,"Nachod apparently likes to brew beers off-the-beaten path. And this wheat beer qualifies as few Czechs brew it.
The similarities to the Bavarian style are strong, but rarely as good as the best Bavarians. Not much head. Not much banana yeast, although the cloves caught my nose. And the Taste is not as complex, but still good and helpfully hopped. 
My bottle had lots more yeasty sentiment than usual, so maybe mine was a bit past its time. But still good.

Reviewed on the ""1001 Beers To Taste Before You Die"", there is lots of interesting historical information... like wheat beers may have originated in Bohemia instead of Bavaria. I guess for that reason, it deserves to be on the list.May 07, 2016"

Taste is wonderful, rich, complex, citrus is light, some mild bread flavors. Nothing sharp or intense, just good balance that blends together very well.

Cloudy yellow, a large foamy white head & good retention. Nice lacing too.

Clove & banana, some bubblegum & a mix of sweet notes including sugar & background fruits. Citrus, in particular orange feature & the beer seems quite fresh.

Bubblegum, banana & clove dominate with orange & citrus plus some coriander around the middle. A traditional, German style taste with some nice sweetness & a touch of spice from the subtle hops that come through too.

Smooth, almost creamy with good carbonation & a lively feel. Spice & a light tang from the citrus helped the beer down & the body was a medium one.

A very good beer & as my first Czech brewed hefeweizen it didn't disappoint & could easily be ranked alongside some of the better German offerings of the style. I'll be picking up again if it ever makes its way into the UK.May 05, 2014"

Smells like a fresh, German style wheat beer should. Bubble gujm, banana and clove balanced delightfully. Yum.

Tastes like the nose. They pretty much nailed it. Wow! I count myself as one who enjoys and appreciates a good German style wheat beer, but I don't remember the last time I enjoyed one so much. Sweetness and light hops add complexity to the yesty-wheaty goodness.

S: Yeast smell is rahter dominant. Coriander is there, some orange and and a hint of banana.

T: It's a weizen for sure but I taste also similarites with the witte trapist of La Trappe (beig a different class of beer). Yeast, lemon, grape sugars, some hops and a slight bitterness.

Smell: Sweet-fresh (a bit like orange), strong wheat, and spicy (clove)

Taste: Sweet (banana??), spicy (clove, which appears to the foreground when the beer warms up) and some typical wheat. There is some nice, very light bitterness in the aftertaste. The sweetness and bitterness of this beer are very well balanced. 

Mouthfeel: Very very soft. Rolls the tongue, creamy and smooth. Medium carbonation.

Being a hefewiezen it is naturally cloudy, which is actually something I like in a beer, being a fan of kvasnicové beers. 

The beer smells like oranges as well, ripe Seville oranges promising a burst of bitterness followed by a delicate sweetness, with floral hints from the Saaz hops. 

In the mouth this beer is an absolute delight, tart, refreshing, with crisp bitterness, which doesn't overwhelm the palate, and again the motif of a thick cut orange marmalade.

Big biscuit malts, floral, spicy, and subtly earthy hops to balance it out on the dry side, as a pilsner should be. Quite smooth feel for a pilsner too.

Krombacher Pils,4.0,4.25,4.25,4.0,"I actually liked this more than I had expected. It's a personal preference, of course, but I prefer a Pils that is rich in noble hops and has nice toasty malt also. Many of the ""craft"" pilsners are too fruity when it comes to the hop notes. When describing the style I prefer I would say: more herbal/floral, green flavors, not so much fruity.Mar 09, 2021"
Krombacher Pils,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a freshness dated 11.2 oz. bottle: bright and clear, golden hue with a quickly receding, foamy white head. It is good to see the imports arriving with freshness dates and brown glass.

Mild spicy aromas of European noble hops - somewhat typical for the style.

What really surprised and disappointed me was the noticeably sweet flavor profile for a German pilsner. There is also a slight, medicinal flavor as well. It reminds me of a poorly brewed, American-micro attempt at a pilsner. Yet there is a nice hop profile that does come through and the sweetness does abate after the lager warms in the glass. I have been very fortunate with the numerous German imports I have been quaffing lately; this broke that chain of good luck. Still, I could have done a lot worse. I also purchased a four-pack of Krombacher Hell. That should be interesting.Feb 21, 2021"
Krombacher Pils,3.75,3.5,3.0,3.5,"Pours a crystal clear, pale golden coloration with a medium, fluffy head. Smells of biscuity, slightly grainy malt and floral, grassy and herbal hops.

Finishes with a light/medium bitterness and some biscuity malt, grassy hops, green apple and a certain mineral note lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.

This makes for a not very enjoyable Fernsehpils that's a bit too sweet and not quite bitter enough for my personal taste, while also featuring some fairly mild, but still somewhat unpleasant tart green apple and mineral/metallic notes in the aftertaste, definitely getting a hint of acetaldehyde here. While there's a decent balance of sweet malt and bitter hops to this, it doesn't feel all that crisp and clean due to the unpleasant notes in the aftertaste.Feb 12, 2021"

Krombacher Pils,4.0,4.25,4.0,3.75,"Wow! Where did yesterday Gose?!? I set off on what I envisioned as a short exCANsion back to The CANQuest (tm) to drink some Goses & Pilsners, both towards Leveling up for badges on sister (?) site, Untappd. Once again, it was like tugging on a loose thread on a sweater & having everything unravel! The entire day was spent drinking seven (7) Goses & one (1) whole Pilsner. 8=( Every time that I moved a sixer around, CANother Gose appeared! Well, today, I am starting out by taking my Pils, lemme tell ya! At last, this one marks my last CANned Pils in my backlog (that I could find, anyway)!

From the CAN: ""Since 1803""; ""No. 1 Premium Beer Brand in Germany""; ""Bier * Beer * Birra * Pivo * Класическа, Светла * Филтрирана Бира, Пастьориэирана * Premium Világos Sör"".

Having transcribed all of that, I was ready for a beer so I beCAN with a Crack! of the vent. I followed this with a slow, gentle C-Line Glug into my awaiting favorite Pilsner glass. This resulted in the formation of two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, French Vanilla-colored head with excellent retention. Color was Straw-Yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4) with NE-quality clarity. The visual was once again that of a scoop of French Vanilla ice cream in a cone or of meringue atop lemon pie filling. Nose had a pronounced bready maltiness, like proofing dough, underlain with the hay-like grassiness of Noble hops. Mmm. Mouthfeel was medium, but after yesterday's Gose excursion, it CANparatively felt like it had some heft! The taste closely followed the nose with the malt(s) leading the way with the hops along for the ride.

It put me in mind of youthful Summers spent at my maternal grandparents' house, whose property abutted a working farm. PapPap would mow the lawn, Grummy would bake biscuits & put them on the sill to cool & I would laze around, reading comic books. Today is a chilly day in early-May & tomorrow is predicted to be ~ 30 degrees below normal for this time of year! I CAN use something to remind me of warm Summer days at this point. 

Previous reviewers have remarked on how smooth & easy-drinking it is & I CANnot agree more! Mine was a 500-ml CAN & a large part of it had disappeared during my typing & transcription. Finish was semi-dry, right at the cusp of semi-sweet without going over the line. Man, this could be crushable under the right circumstances! I'd love to have this in my Summer cooler. YMMV.May 09, 2020"

Krombacher Pils,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"I agree with Rich from t see how anyone could rate any of the American micros ahead of this, or DAB, or any other decent euro pils. The USA does not lager well. I've had myriad micros from all over the US. Nothing even comes close to Krom, in terms of lager, let alone pils style. 5s for what it is - a German session pils. Not complex; but good malt quality (which we very sadly lack in the US). I love some US mircos; but have to expect the fact we'll never be able to produce a pils as good as this and a zillion others across the pond. I'm drinking one right now and loves the malt, nice use of different hops and smooth, slightly dry, finish. Half done, so nice lace on glass and the full flavor of the good malt used. If we could produce anything near this in the US, I'd make the switch. I'll be waiting a long time, I fear. I used to buy this for about $11 a twelve of 11.2 ouncers. reduced to $6 because you micro nuts are buying very weak versions of this bier style. Thank you! Saved me some cash.

The best before date is 2/07/20. Guessing it was brewed on 2/07/19 as that is the first date on the can. Beer could be getting a little long in the tooth. 

The nose is light. A bit grain and some floral notes. 

The taste is slightly sweet with a bit or astringency. There are some cracker notes and that floral aroma carrier over into the taste. The beer would be super easy to pair with non-spicy food but anything with a lot of flavor will overwhelm it. 

The mouth is medium to thin and could use a bit more carbonation.

So, to be fair, it's better than anything Budweiser serves. But, if you like big beers you'll hate it. Looks nice, smells ok but there just isn't too much flavor here. It's like a super watered down Scotch Ale to me. I'll drink it while I'm over here but as soon as I get back to the stages, it's big beer for me.Apr 30, 2017"

Asahi Dry Black,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.5,"ASAHI!!! Surprisingly this is my first Asahi review, yes I’ve had their average-versus-all-the-other-average-Japanese-Lagers Super Dry Lager, but I’ve never gotten around to reviewing it... probably because it’s so average... it should be called “Asahi Average Dry Lager” but I guess that doesn’t have the marketing cachet of “Super Dry”... in any case I’m preparing myself for another average Asahi experience, this time I’m taking notes.

Poured from the odd-sized 334ml bottle into a pokal.

A: Black (deep ruby like a Guinness when you shine a torch through it) body with a beige 1cm head that sticks around well. It comes as advertised then Mr. Asahi [insert Japanese bow here]. 8/10.

S: It has that off barley/wheat grain aroma that I’ve encountered MANY times before in Australian macro Lagers... off-putting actually... with hints of sweet malt and roasted barley but naught much else. Colour me disappointed then. 4/10.

T: Wow, this is really quite bad - upfront stale grain/bread characters followed by a soapy chemical flavour, slight sweet malts, and yet more grain. Finish is a mild sour funk with hints of hop bitterness. For the first time in a long while I’m considering the drain for this brew... I’ll persevere for my readers but boy is this ‘orrible. 4/10.

M: Watery almost light body with an almost flat carbonation. 5/10.

D: This is one terrible brew with no real redeeming features - for a moment I questioned if I was being overly harsh on Asahi Dry Black... then I took another sip: Nope, not being harsh at all, this is crap. This is the made in Japan stuff too! I know Japan brews better than this, check out Baird Beer, Hitachino Nest and Coedo Brewery if you want to taste the real Japan, this Asahi is shit. 4/10.

Food match: The flavours of this beer don’t even lend well to Sushi, at least their crisp Super Dry Lager is OK with Sushi, the only match for this brew is the kitchen sink.

NB: I did end up pouring half the bottle down the drain, lesson learned.Jun 19, 2015"

Asahi Dry Black,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,"So, I'll begin; I'm a Washington native, and have lived in the NL, been to Brugge, drink craft beer like all the time. With that said, this is going to be skewed; though, in my opinion, all beer is beer.

I poured this thing out after drinking about 80ml, which is a shame, because it cost 210yen; hardly justifiable. Between $2-3 is the price all beers go for at supermarkets and convenience stores in Japan. I just can't reconcile with putting garbage into my body for two dollars.

Anyways, why I poured it out? Taste was like every cheap lager you could imagine; with the death liquid from Prometheus' appearance. The scent, yeah, non existent. The taste, bitter, no after taste; utter crap. 

For those of you seeking some depth as to why the big four Japanese beer companies are essentially the same, I just wrote a research paper in regards to this. In short, Asahi is the go to consumer marketing beer; more so than others. Super dry was designed and styled to catch materialistic people's attention, merely desiring the culture of beer after work, and a light taste to wash down food. It is very light, and is very popular among Japanese women for this; which the beer industry largely began to cater towards after the 1960s, and especially after the early 2000s with worker equality. The other beers, mind you, are not much better. Japan has some good micro brews like Baird, Swan Lake, etc; but far too few and very expensive due to the tax, importing of ingredients, protectionism of crap companies like Asahi, etc. 

Long story short, save the 200 yen if you're here and buy something good, like tea or something used at BookOff.Jun 25, 2014"

Asahi Dry Black,2.75,1.75,2.0,3.25,"Poured from a can I bought from the AAA store on Okinawa. Two fingers of head on top of dark rootbeer quickly melt away leaving no lacing. The nose holds tin, wet grain and light malts, it has that MBC stadium beer smell.
The flavor offers more than the nose, but is still very mild. If corn grits, white rice and seltzer water made a child the child would taste like this beer. There is a brief bitterness in the background which I would assume is from hops. Medium body and big bubbles are what I find the most enjoyable part of this beer. 

Overall I would not recommend this beer, but hey, you may enjoy it.Mar 02, 2013"
Asahi Dry Black,3.75,2.75,3.0,2.75,"I wasn't too sure where to place this lager but I guess it's close to European dark. The can has ""karakuchi"" written on it which according to Wikipedia means ""fully attenuated"" or ""dry beer"".

A: As dark ruby as can be without being black. Initially a good off-white head.

S: Dark malts and a rubber/straw odour I associate with certain hefeweizens.

T: Dry, cardboard and a touch of ginger. Some lemony citrus in the aftertaste. Overall pretty hollow.

M: Light and a touch frothy.

Mariachi,3.5,4.25,4.25,4.0,"Latest bottling, specifying ""Apple Brandy."" I will maintain this review under the original ""Brandy Barrel"" entry unless the brewery decides a separate entry is warranted.

Basically no head; a slight fizz eventually appears, but quickly disappears to a completely calm, flat body with no hint of foam. Body is a dark, purplish-black.
Edit: second pour from the same bomber (a full day later) produced a very solid 1/2 finger of dark foam, including modest retention - albeit from a more turbulent pour. Still, the head reaction from two different pours, from the same bottle, is baffling. The rating has been adjusted to reflect the second pour, which is likely more true to an on tap experience.

Apple brandy notes are quite noticeable on the nose, to the extent that very few of the many flavor additives are noticeable. There is a slight, nutty char, chocolate, brown sugar, red grapes, and vinous peppers, along with perhaps some cream, vanilla, and cinnamon notes that tend to blend in with the brandy.

Very similar presentation on the palate, with the apple brandy treatment at the forefront, and maintaining prominence throughout the sip. Cinnamon and peppers add accents in the first third, with just a kiss of chocolate. The middle is almost entirely apple brandy, cinnamon, vanilla, and cream, before dark chocolate and cinnamon carry the finish. Peppers carry virtually no heat (likely due to the time spent in the barrels), but there is a bit of a green, vinous touch present primarily up front, blending with oak and brandy.

Despite the lack of head, the body is just lively enough - and full bodied enough - that it works very well. The sip is quite long with a lingering finish. Slick.

A lot of the original character of El Mariachi is lost in the mix here. Chocolate is definitely noticeable, but not as strongly as in the original; the peppers are an afterthought; and while the vanilla and cinnamon are prominent, they blend with the barrel so well as to not actually stand out. That might sound like a criticism .... if it didn't work. Fortunately, it really, really works! The result is a delicious treat, neither hot nor overly sweet.Oct 02, 2019"
Mariachi,3.5,4.25,4.0,4.25,"650ml bottle, Brandy Barrel Aged stamped on the label, 2017 vintage, poured into a 14oz snifter glass.

The beer pours a deep black color, cola brown hues with a thin tan head that has no retention and only a few spots of lace clinging to the glass. The aroma is great, bakers chocolate, light spice, a bit of heat, caramel forward cognac barrel, light wood and vanilla. The flavors are very good, rich and decadent, tons of chocolate, smooth grains, smooth cognac barrel, oak and brown sugar, light stone fruits, sweet vanilla bean with a light heat from the pepper blend. The mouthfeel is good, silky and smooth medium body that coats well and finishes easily with a touch of heat from the peppers and warmth from the booze. 

Verdict: A good barrel aged stout from Aardwolf. The cognac is really nice and helps tone down the pepper heat but the balance is great, the vanilla comes across well and the chocolate character is excellent. Nicely done beer.Mar 26, 2018"

Mariachi,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,"Thanks to moose3285 for a couple bottles from this brewery, I enjoyed the first one, let’s hope I go 2 for 2. A concept my Twins are wholly unfamiliar with at the moment. 

The pour is impenetrable, with few bubbles even on a hard pour. The nose is nice, dark sweetness, baking cocoa, apple cider spices. Warm. I like. 

El Mariachi - Brandy Barrel Aged tastes like rum to me rather than brandy, likely due to the spiciness running up, down, & through the line of scrimmage. Cinnamon, nutmeg, & vanilla appear before the beautifully balanced chiles come mincing across the palate. The heat is exquisitely added: not too much, not too little, but juuust right. Sticky. I could drink an entire bomber of this happily. 

Whipping up a chile beer is not easy: too little & you are left with a boring stout, too much & you have Crime & Punishment eating your drain pipes like sulfuric acid. This gets the balance right (with apologies to Dave Gahan). Excellent beer.Apr 10, 2016"
Mariachi,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Really enjoyed this beer. Pitch black with a thin amber head. The nose on this beer is incredible picking up chocolate, cinnamon, a bit of pepper and heavy barrel notes. The pepper flavor minus the heat comes through and the brandy barrel is perfect compliment. Great thick feel. This is a great beer.Sep 04, 2015"
Mariachi,4.0,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Big thanks to Warren for hooking me up with a bottle of this in our most recent exchange. I was a huge fan of the base beer when I got to try it on tap at Aardwolf so the idea of brandy barrel aging this just seems too good to be true.

Bomber poured into an oversized snifter. It appears black in color with a tan cap that holds with just a ring around the perimeter. Rising bubbles maintain just a line around the edge of the glass.

The nose encompasses notes of chocolate, anise and solvent alcohol. A minor earthy pepper character with faint woody cinnamon and vanilla sweetness. The taste is roasty with solvent alcohol, bitter chocolate, earth, slight pepper that gives a bit of vegetal feel. Some vanilla sweetness emerges as it warms.

This is medium bodied and modestly carbonated. A decent brew that sadly pales in comparison to how fantastic the base, non-barrel aged version is. Having had 2 different BA beers from these guys, I just get the feeling that id rather have their plain non barrel aged offerings instead of these limited releases.Sep 03, 2015"
Mariachi,4.5,5.0,5.0,4.75,"So happy to have gotten this in a trade, this beer was truly wonderful.

Look: Oil black, with a fine light brown head.

Smell: The peppers do magic for the nose, giving it an almost cinnamony scent when mixed with the strong Brandy notes.

Taste: Wow, brandy chocobomb. I let this warm for over an hour and this beer just kept getting more complex and drinkable.

Feel: A little on the thin side, but only slightly. Oily.

Overall: I need to try more of these Aardwolf Brewing Company beers, because this is one amazing beer and I need to see what else these guys can do!Aug 30, 2015"
Mariachi,4.5,4.75,5.0,4.75,"Finally getting around to my first review! Here goes:

Look: Jet black and oily with a minimal one finger tan head that dissipates quickly but leaves nice lacing as the beer is consumed.

Smell: Lots of sweet brandy alcohol on the nose mixed with big chocolate notes. This beer is very inviting and smells heavenly.

Taste: Just like the smell, the brandy barrel shines through beautifully in this one and it's the first thing I taste. The vanilla mixes well with the barrel to create an almost toasted marshmallow taste. As I swirl the sip around my mouth I am getting lots of rich earthy, chocolate. Slight ashy,leathery, star anise notes too. At first I barely notice a small burn of the peppers at the back of my throat but they become more prevalent as the beer warms. This beer finishes with a big chocolate kick mixed with that sweet pepper burn and it coated my cheeks to where I could taste it for the next half hour. Very nice!

Feel: Smooth, and oily with no alcohol burn whatsoever. No too chewy, I'd give it a 5 out of 10 on the viscosity range.

Overall: A great beer from Jacksonville's best brewery. They really knocked it out of the park with this one. I was so impressed I went back and bought 7 bottles, one for each of my groomsmen in my wedding recently. Cheers!Aug 29, 2015"
Mariachi,5.0,5.0,4.75,5.0,"Great mouthfeel. Strong brandy on the nose. Every element shines. The only negative is non barrel aged El Mariachi has great heat on the backend and the barrel aging has basically killed the pepper contribution. Get that solved and this will be a world class brew.Jul 17, 2015"
Mariachi,4.5,4.0,4.25,4.75,"Dark chocolate fudge and vanilla bean take center stage here. The mouth feel is medium to full. It coats the mouth pretty well and leaves some lacing on the glass. There is an enjoyable kick from the Brandy and everything is very smooth and well balanced. I don't get much heat from the peppers until a third of the way through the glass when it starts to build in the back of the throat. Don't go into this one looking to get blown away by cinnamon, spice, and barrel character. All are present, but in moderation. This is still a very good beer, and could be a great beer if they figure out how to get more of the adjuncts to stand out without disrupting the balance.Jun 30, 2015"

T: dark chocolate, complex. Brandy oak coming in and out and in and out of the flavor. Dynamic beer. So easy to drink. My one complaint is that the heat has dwindled but that is understood as a result of the aging. Without the expectation of the spice this beer is top tier.

M: silky smooth, can't get any better. Perfect degree of thickness.

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's been a while since I've had a dunkleweissbier. Years in fact. My last trip to Germany was in September of 2017, and it looks like my last one was in Nürnberg. I don't generally go for the dunkle because I feel the darker malts block some of the yeast character. This one is a classic though. It's a very dark chestnut and mahogany brown beneath a full head of tan foam. The aroma is clean, lightly sweet, and bready with a note that's similar to Ovaltine. The flavor follows but brings with it some of the banana that's normally found in weizen, and a little bit of clove shows at the finish as well. It's sweetish and nutty, but balanced, and there's also a little bit of grassy hop and cocoa left lingering. Ahhh, I've forgotten how drinkable this style is! It doesn't seem quite as sweet to me as a standard weizen and thus there's no pausing, I just keep drinking until it's gone. In the mouth it's medium bodied, and as expected, lively and effervescent. It's definitely a modern classic.

L: med-dark, burgundy-brown liquid; explosive foam build on the pour (half the bottle in first, wait, emptied remainder on second pour); foam keeps a dense, silky structure up top, more open and spongy around the glass edge; great retention, slow recede; but little lacing

S: fruity, almost grape juice aroma immediately; subtle hints of thick, toasty, brown bread crust slowly emerge, soon followed by more caramel-like malt... with the (small) yeast slug finally added, the overall smell is simply grainy brown bread, with subtle caramelized toast flourishes; grassy, leafy notes later develop

T: first sip: vaguely-thin, brown-bready malt foundation, subtle chocolate-caramel accents to the doughy malt... as it goes: lingering almost Cocoa-puff, cereal grain flavor lingering most prominently in the aftertaste, along with some background roasty toastiness, hints of med-roast coffee grounds... perhaps some floral hop character in the background; little classic yeast character (banana, clove)

F: mildly (doppel)bock like swell to its body, with a soft presence of alcohol building over the course; fluffy (highly-carbonated) texture... mellow residual silty film left behind... substantial girth, but lifts enough, narrowly avoiding a sluggish flow

Smell: A little yeasty, a little malty, some spice, there is a sweetness in there as well. 
Taste: Like the smell, some yeast and spice, some caramel and malt. There is the slightest touch of roastiness towards the end, not getting much in the way of hops.

Erdinger Weissbier Dunkel,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I'm used to Weiss beers that feature the yeast. This is a different take. The emphasis is on the Dunkle. A great looking beer.

Just enough Hallertau to lightly bitter the finish. Very lightly. Not much coming from the yeast. Feel is smooth and mildly carbonated. Easy drinking and sessionable.

Nose of dark muddled malts topped with some shaved chocolate, some hops and an intriguing yet rather light wheat character.

Taste is creamy with a mixed malt character and a smooth finely carbonated feel. Somewhat light on the wheat like their standard hefe leaves me a bit short but that allows for an easy drinking brew as well.Jul 27, 2020"
Erdinger Weissbier Dunkel,4.0,3.75,4.0,3.75,"Having this with a calzone - An Italo-Roman-Barbarian-Germanic combo. 

Pours a deep brown color with a fizzy but foamy head that recedes. Nothing over powering in both the aromas and flavour which contain for the most part, yeast, prunes, banana, and malt. Sweet, no bitterness and high carbonation I like this beer has an elegant touch but a resolute power to it. That is, it may not pack an immediate punch but you feel it later on in the session.Jul 22, 2020"
Erdinger Weissbier Dunkel,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"I've had this beer a couple of times, most recently at a restaurant in Hamburg in August 2019 at an academic workshop. I've also had it from a bottle purchased in North America. Anyway, it had notes of carmel on draft, I think I prefer Munich Dunkel because this style has less roasted malt taste and is sweeter.May 04, 2020"
Erdinger Weissbier Dunkel,4.0,2.0,3.5,3.5,"Very refreshing, clean finish. Won't drive anyone away with overpowering flavor but is really pleasant. Solid session beer. I imagine it would be a great daily beer to have on tap in the kegerator. Went very well with Barro's Pizza from out here in Arizona. Want to try it with steak next.May 02, 2020"
Erdinger Weissbier Dunkel,5.0,3.5,4.5,4.5,"A: Fizzy tan head with audible carbonation. Head dissipates quickly. Dark brown with ruby highlights.

S: Brown bread dough. Dark malt, but not much. I do not detect any hop aroma, but perhaps it's there, but subtle, and I'm not picking up on it.

T: Pumpernickel bread, with just a hint of sweetness. Finishes with a slight hoppy bite. Very well balanced. Exactly what I would expect in this style. I do not detect any banana or clove yeast character. 

M: Highly carbonated. Luscious texture, closer to milk than water in its viscosity.

O: A highly satisfying brew with a malt-balanced flavor profile and a pleasing fizzyness that makes me want another when I reach the end of the pint size bottle. True to its Bavarian weissbier roots, a great example of the Dunkles Weissbier style.Apr 26, 2020"
Erdinger Weissbier Dunkel,4.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,"Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle into a pub glass on March 8, the 'best by' date is end of July 2020. Code below that is L1022072 fwiw... anyway, from the brewer's perspective this is a fresh product with 4 months left of shelf life.

It's cola dark with a light tan head of about a finger, which recedes fairly quickly to 1/8th inch.... but that layer lasts and lasts, it just never fully goes absent. I don't get alot of distinguishable aromas, just a subtle hint of raisin. Taste also is quite subtle dark fruits, this becomes more pronounced as the beer warms after 10 minutes or so. Carbonation seems high initially, but smooths out as the minutes pass. The feel is a bit thin at first, but again this one requires some time to fully enjoy.

I find it quite nice if consumed patiently, otherwise if too quickly downed it could pass for a Shiner Bock and be fairly unimpressive.Mar 08, 2020"
Erdinger Weissbier Dunkel,4.0,3.75,3.75,3.75,"From the 500ml bottle - Imperial nonic style glass

Pours an opaque dark cola brown with a thick foamy dark khaki head that settles to a thin cap on the surface. A few foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Dark wheat malt is abundant, I get banana bread wth a carmalized sugary sweetness. Moderate chocolate with some floral hops and an earthy spice yeast note. A little thin and watery, but sessionable in that sense. Drinks bigger than the 5.3% ABV listed on the label. Nice to check this style out but not something I would probably go seeking out often.Mar 06, 2020"
Erdinger Weissbier Dunkel,5.0,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Pours murky brown with a large head.
The aroma is light roast with some banana and clove. Fairly neutral for the style.
The flavor is sweet dark malts and a mild bana and clove,
Overall it’s not bad, but there are definitely more full flavored beers in the style. I know they’re private but this tastes like an AB InBev version of a dark wheat.Feb 27, 2020"
Erdinger Weissbier Dunkel,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.0,"Big head production, decent retention. No noticeable lacing. Between the color of the body (dark, nutty brown) and the head (dark tan foam), it looks like dark wheat bread in a glass.

""Dunkel-"" rules the nose over ""-weizen,"" with strong notes of prunes and cola, along with pumpernickel, rye, nuts, and a dry aspirin-like note.

Much more balanced on the palate, with banana and clove from the yeast, and milky tones from the wheat, all blending with the dark malt base. Cola, prune, nuts, and dark bread.

Slick and nearly flat on the palate; unsurprising perhaps given the poor head retention.Jan 12, 2020"
Erdinger Weissbier Dunkel,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.75,"Crisp malt and the sweetness is easily detectable. Holds well against it’s counterparts as the head stays longer than expected. As expected, taste does vary if refrigerated compared to room temp.Dec 22, 2019"

Taste: Medium bitterness, heavier on malt, some complexity
Feel: A real tongue tingler, flavor stays after swallowing, dry finish
Overall: A nice representation of the style. Not my favorite style, but solid. Grab it if you want the feel of an adjunct lager but you need more flavor in your beer.
Pair with grilled meats, mild cheddar or a havarti.Sep 27, 2021"
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.75,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Purchased as a single bottle from Kroger for $1.67. Poured into a pils glass.

L - Dark copper and clear, with a two-finger sudsy cream head.
S - Sweet crackers and caramel. Maybe a bit of citron.
T - Spicy citrus leads into a tasty breadiness and some nice peppery notes. Floral and earthy notes. Slightly bitter citrus finish. Very well-balanced. Caramel and honey throughout.
F - Medium-light body with plenty of carbonation. Very smooth. Extremely drinkable. Chewy on the finish.
O - I've had this many times, and I'm pleased to review it for once! A surprisingly complex and extremely well-balanced lager. Malt-forward at the start, and hoppy through to the end. Fantastic bang-for-the-buck. Will purchase again, and I highly recommend this!

Samuel Adams Boston Lager,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"As far as lagers go, this is a standard reference for me. Slightly sweet, hoppy, decent carbonation. Nothing really standing out but it all works good. For a macro brew, this is hard to beat. Excellent with any food.Sep 19, 2021"
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.0,3.0,2.25,3.0,"When this beer was making its way around the market I wanted to try it. Being a Philly Native and before Tom Brady era and before well the whole Boston losing to Flyers in game 7 in 2010, and before the 2003 incident, there was a humble brewery in Boston that wanted to shake the world up by making a beer and telling people, ""this is the beer you want when you grow up a little"" implying that older 27 to 49 year olds were drinking this like a SIR! This beer f!cking blows ass! They use so much hops it ruins the beer. They even showed you on TV how much hops they used and made fun of other breweries for making their beers with little hops. Newsflash! TOO much hops = TOO MUCH ALPHA ACIDS and your beer now tastes like a godawful run of the mill IPA.Sep 18, 2021"

Samuel Adams Boston Lager,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,"In lieu of certain recent news, it was time to support the stalwart and review it. A brown twelve ounce bottle has been emptied into a clear pint glass. It's a beautiful bright, shiny and somewhat translucent copper-amber. The head was white and just about perfect for the force of the pour. Much of it endures. This time, a refrigerated beer is being reviewed by me. There's a very pleasant malt-hop combination to smell and it likely would be enhanced were the serving closer to room temperature. The taste is malty without being overly sweet and balanced by some earthy hoppiness. The glass lacing completes a very pretty visual. This drinks so much smoother than any adjunct lager it sometimes gets blamed to be among. Taste is a subjective thing, but it astounds that there are advocates that truly believe Budweiser and the others make a superior lager. Perhaps because with a full malt body and an obvious hop finish, this drinks closer to an ale than a lager. There are good ales lighter in body and taste than this. So, if the heaviness here isn't a lager lover's tea party, it's understandable.Aug 02, 2021"
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,4.25,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Poured from a bottle into pint glass on July 24, 2021. There was an ""Enjoy Before"" date of October 2021 on the bottle.

Appearance: Deep amber, with nice thick and light colored head. The head lasted a very long time, and left a nice coating on the inside of the glass.

Smell: Pleasant, with a nice balance of sweet malts and hops bitterness in the aroma. These aromas balance the malt and hops for a nice aroma.

Taste: A nice mix of hops, malts, and herbs in the flavor, that make for an interesting and complex lager, but with a little bit of sweetness. There is a little pepper edge to the flavor. Nice after-taste, that lasts for a while but not too long.

Mouthfeel: Smooth and crisp, with a light body.

Overall: This is an interesting and complex lager. I would buy and drink this again.Jul 24, 2021"
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,"One of my favorite beers. You really can't go wrong with a Sam Adams Boston Lager. It's about as hoppy of a beer I like without being bitter as all can get, yet still taste refreshing and easy to drink. If someone tells you Americans don't know how to make good beer tell them to stop drinking most of the cheap stuff made here and to pick up a Sams Boston Lager. Blows a Bud Lite or similar beer to smithereens.Jun 07, 2021"
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,4.0,4.25,4.0,4.0,"This is just a solid classic. Had a nice tan head, bready malt aroma. Was light, sweet with hints of caramel. There is a good bitterness in the finish. Still a good beer after all these years.May 16, 2021"
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,4.5,3.75,4.25,4.25,"Some beer snobs give this beer the ordinary nothing outstanding. However poured into glass from bottle. Dense head not huge but says. Wonder color clear and just right. The beer is complex really with real balance. If you have drank this over the years it might seem nothing special. Again the more I drink it the better I like it. Malt with just right mix of hoppy character. For a 5% by volume one of the best beers for feel and taste. Really an American original in every way.Apr 09, 2021"
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,4.0,3.75,3.75,4.0,"Pale copper lager. As far as nationally available beers this one is pretty solid. Fairly complex with hints of bread. I enjoy this several times a year. While it won’t wow you it’s readily available and a decent pour.Apr 09, 2021"
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,4.25,3.25,4.0,3.75,"Boston Lager pours a light copper hue with a nice white head and a good amount of carbonation. The aroma doesn't have a whole lot going on though. It reminds me faintly of bread with a bit of sweetness. The flavor is better however. The bread really starts to come out while being a bit sweet and having hints of caramel. The finish has a decent amount of bitterness but it isn't terribly dry. Overall this is a pretty good beer.Mar 29, 2021"
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,"Appearance: Straight from the fridge and into a clear mug, the first thing I noticed is relatively small bubbles in the healthy head. Fairly strong carbonation generates a good amount of fine bubbles in the pale amber liquid. It looks crisp and clear with decent head retention. Overall strong score right off the bat.

Aroma: Malt and caramel dominate on the nose, with an undertone of honey and citrus. Very appealing, can’t wait to dive in.

Taste: Malt and honey hit me first, then the caramel flavours start to move in and the citrus really comes through in the finish. A slight bitter aftertaste in a very pleasing way with the citrus and honey flavours lingering. Fairly well balanced and slightly sweet, but as the IBU indicates, on the strong side for a lager, which I really enjoy and find crisp and refreshing. Excellent and not overpowering; a new favourite.

Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation and a moderately lingering aftertaste. This is the one category where I find this beer to be fairly average; I prefer a but more carbonation and a bit more on the back end.

Overall: This is one of my new favourite beers. I’ll certainly be adding it to my regular rotation and keeping some in the fridge going forward. I like the simple, crisp feeling and the balanced honey and caramel flavours, and it’s got an great amount of bitterness for any occasion.Mar 06, 2021"

Samuel Adams Boston Lager,4.0,3.25,3.75,4.0,"""Remastered"" version. ""Enjoy before"" date of March 2021.

Lightly hazy orange-amber, with moderate pale tan head. 

Smells of light caramel , with faint mixed citrus and spiciness. 

Some light floral/fruitiness(halfway? between Pils & helles) , with some of the caramelly malt flavors show through, though less than ""regular"" SABL, finishing with some noble hop spiciness and touch of the malt . A light drying bitterness lingers awhile after finish. In the grapefruit pith vein, but less noticeably so , than when it is warm.

Feel is light-medium, with slight syrupy slickness, and moderate very fine carbonation bite. 

Overall, I'm still on the fence as to which version of SABL I like better, but I do like this. It's just different : a bit hoppier, and less noticeable caramel maltiness. The last few ""regular"" SABLs I had were draft, with dinner, at restaurants (Remember THAT? ;) ) , so maybe that would tilt it towards this, in a bottle-to-bottle comparison? ???

ps : My initial impression , on the first one (below) . Short version : drink them cold/coldish.
[Got side-tracked , & the first one warmed up to 50F? A bit strange . A slightly sour, fruity flavor , somewhere between mixed citrus & dried cherry .That, + a bitter grapefruit pith sensation is lingering at the back of the palate, several minutes afterward.Did get some caramel malt flavor peeking through on the latter half of the glass ]Dec 12, 2020"
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"The first one is ALWAYS fantastic and just has that distinct Sam flavor and bite. Sorry, this brew truly merits a five.

San Miguel Pale Pilsen,3.25,3.25,3.0,3.5,"Not sure if this is the same beer that is listed as San Miguel lager so thought I would give it a review. This one I liked quite a bit more then my last San Miguel lager experience. May be a beer age issue....

Poured from a bottle into a pint glass

Appearance – The beer pours a clear lighter golden color with a one finger head of white foam. The head has a fair level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a decent sum of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

Smell – The aroma of the brew is strong of a bready and caramel smell with just a touch of hay and herb.

Taste – The taste is much as one may anticipate from the nose. It begins with a bready malt flavor that is matched with a moderate showing of caramel. As the taste advances the caramel fades a tad while some very light herbal hop and some grain comes to the tongue. A bit of corn syrup joins the mix and with the bready, grain, caramel, and very light hop which take the taste to the end, one is left with a very middle of the road pilsner taste to linger on the tongue.

Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is medium to light with a carbonation level that is average to slightly higher. Overall the feel is good for the style and makes for an easy drinker.

Overall – An alright pils, but nothing all the exceptional. Middle to slightly loweroverall.Jul 28, 2021"
San Miguel Pale Pilsen,3.0,3.0,2.75,2.75,"San Miguel Pale Pilsen is as crystal clear and pale as any lager you can imagine. The head is rocky, white, and reasonably lasting.

This San Miguel smells like the same combination of dried grains and white bread as almost every other mainstream lager. It also has a corn flavored sweetness to it coupled with a very generic fresh fruit character. Nothing I can specifically nail down but something musty and generic. The finish is likewise vague and peppery in its hoppiness.

On the tongue, San Miguel Pale Pilsen is smooth, crisp, and refreshing. It tastes more like dried grains and general mustiness and less like soda crackers or fresh baked bread. The center seems to thin out somewhat, taking on more musty flavors of ripe sweet corn. The finish gives me a dry, earthy, peppery sort of hop finish.

In a lot of ways, this has the qualities I'd look for in a pilsner. After all, it is crisp, clean, and refreshing. Aside from corn and the odd musty, dusty flavor there's not a lot of negative flavors going on. That being said, the flavors just don't balance each other as well as they could, hence the lower score.May 21, 2021"

M: Light bodied with solid carbonation. Fairly refreshing.
O: This was a reasonable example of the Pilsener style. If we are comparing this to other Pilseners, it's actually a pretty well made one. I also appreciate that it is placed in brown bottles, as, despite being imported from the other side of the world, it drinks fresh and unskunked.Jul 27, 2017"
San Miguel Pale Pilsen,3.5,2.75,2.5,2.5,"Look: It pours light golden with a white head It has moderate head retention with some lacing. 

Smell: It has grainy sweet aroma with some herbal and grass as well. 

Taste: The flavors are dominated by a malty, grainy sweetness. There are some grassy elements with herbal flavors as well. 

Feel: It has a moderately light body with moderately low bitterness. The aftertaste is grainy sweet. 

Overall, it is a lager with mostly malty aromas and flavors, but not without some hops that are noticeable.Apr 13, 2017"
San Miguel Pale Pilsen,3.0,3.0,1.75,3.0,"Looks like a pilsener. Head is more pillowy than american adjunct lagers that I’m used to, but still soapy enough to dwindle to a thin layer as I type this.

Smell is a cross between coors and corona. That beery macro smell with an extra hint of skunk sweetness. 

Taste: whoa. There’s definitely something different here. Honeysuckle, brown rice, sugar cane. With so little backbone, the 5% ABV is detectable. Further swigs reveal leafy greens, tree bark, and green bell pepper. I’m glad I tried it because it’s something different, but I can’t say I’m enjoying it.Jan 04, 2017"
San Miguel Pale Pilsen,3.25,2.25,2.0,3.25,"L: Packaging in the PH looks great and rustic; the glass bottles give off a familiar and cozy feel. Beer itself is light golden in color, very clear and has quite an amount carbonation.

S: You'll notice a very sweet , almost floral, aroma once you open it. The smell is most apparent when you meet up with someone who has been drinking at most an hour ago.

T: Being marketed as beer for the masses means it would taste something like it (A liter costs something like 70 PHP retail or around 1.20 USD in the PH). Quite sweet and floral when you start drinking with only a touch of bitterness at the end. I wouldn't describe the bitterness a something liken to hops. Eventually the bitter aftertaste of the beer will overpower the overly sweet taste that is initially dominant (after going through 1.5L of it perhaps). Generally poor taste compared to other mass brewed pilsners. 

F: Has a very light body and continues to feel as such no matter how much you drink it. Can be drunk as is without snacks or accompaniment for long periods of time.

O: Despite it being the defacto national beer of the Philippines, I wouldn't drink a San Mig at a pub or restaurant given there are other choices. Its overly sweet flavor profile fit well with its target market others might have a different palette. Technically a pretty poor beer but thanks to its drinkability as its own its a popular choice for parties or long talks between friends.Dec 17, 2016"

Soft and light-bodied, with an approachable pilsner malt dominant taste. No grassy Noble hop character, unfortunately.

Balanced albeit simple, San Miguel Pale Pilsen is a somewhat refreshing light lager decent for pairing with spicy Southeast Asian food, but beyond that it has little to offer the discerning drinker.

Weizen,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,"The bottle boasts that this is the world's most popular Weissbier. Could that be simply because it's readily available? For some reason this guy and Paulaner are the two German Weissbiers that are always in stock at local liquor stores, except maybe the discount ones in the bad parts of town. Otherwise, I can't see why it would be the most popular. Maybe people buy it because they see that it's Bavarian, read the import price tag, and assume it must be good. I know I did the first time I bought it. Not that there's anything offensive about this beer, it's just not as good as I hoped. Anyway, here's the review.

Poured from a bottle into a Weissbier glass. Foamy, three finger head, tons of carbonation, seems like even more carbonation than you'd expect from a Weissbier. (I defy you to swig this without belching). Let the carbonation settle a bit, the head sticks around 5 minutes later.
Smell - mild. I don't know that in a blind smell test I could tell it's a Weissbier. Mild, hint of yeast, maybe a tiny hint of the typical banana, or maybe I'm just anticipating it- it's that mild. And on the back end a hint of what I can only describe as ""bottle depot"".
Taste - I hesitate to say bland... it's mild, put it that way. Up front, totally inoffensive, but you'd never guess it's a Bavarian. Tiniest hint of clove on the back end, next to no fruit/banana taste you get with most Weissbiers. Aftertaste brings more of that ""bottle depot"" taste, but not in a particularly offensive way.
Feel - smooth, except for the carbonation. I advise you to let this one simmer down a little before quaffing.
Overall - not a bad beer by any means, but not worth the premium price either. In fact, every single other German Weissbier I've tried was better. I would only recommend Erdinger to maybe someone who swears by light lagers, just to get them to branch out into a different style without scaring them off. But honestly, I'd probably just pick something better for that.Aug 11, 2021"
Weizen,2.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,"500 ml can poured into a nonic pint glass. Pours a hazy straw yellow with a quickly fading head and not much lacing. Kind of disappointing for a hefeweizen.

Weizen,4.5,3.75,3.75,4.0,"Look: Pours a cloudy medium yellow with hints of orange. The head is bright white and soft, topping out around 1 1/2 fingers. After 5 minutes the head has dissapated slowly and sits at a 1/3 finger of covering across the glass.

Smell: Hints of lemon, mixed with clove and spring breeze. Floral but delicately so. Touches of banana and dough.

Taste: Cloves and banana. Soft and round and quite well balenced. Very smooth and subtle. Nothing about this beer packs a wollup, everything is about balence and proportion. 

Feel: Light/Medium bodied, smooth and silky with a round finish. 

This beer is a strong B+. Are there better German Hefe-Weizen's, yes.....but this is a perfectly good substitute for a relaxing summer afternoon.Jun 25, 2021"
Weizen,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.25,"Pours a slightly cloudy, deep golden coloration with a medium, frothy head and slightly visible carbonation. Smells of doughy malt, grassy hops and hints of spicy yeast esters, as well as a certain mineral note. Taste is a decent balance of sweet'ish doughy malt, very light spicy/fruity yeast esters of banana and clove, as well as some bitter, grassy hops and a certain mineral note also coming through. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some grassy hops, hints of clove and that certain mineral note lingering in the aftertaste. Soft mouthfeel with a light/medium body and medium/strong carbonation.

This Hefeweizen is seriously lacking in that typical estery yeast character to me, while it also feels somewhat light-bodied and over-carbonated, despite a decent, soft mouthfeel. While some clove is noticeable, there very little banana to be found here, with the flavor profile being dominated by rather sweet malt and grassy hops, as well as a certain minerality. The balance just doesn't work out at all for me here, with this being quite sweet despite lacking in a rich maltiness, the yeast esters being way too weak here, while the grassy, mineral notes are too pronounced for my personal taste. One of the worst Hefeweizens I've ever had, to be honest.Jun 19, 2021"
Weizen,3.75,3.25,3.25,3.25,"On tap and from bottle, on numerous occasions. A refreshing and crisp summer beer. However, my initial admiration for this beer has been somewhat lowered, after finding other weissbiers with more flavour.Apr 20, 2021"
Weizen,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Erdinger Weissbier is delicately hazy and a pale amber in color with hints of nectarine jam. The head is cloudy, bone white, and lasting.
The aroma starts off delicate and yeasty, with an underlying presence of bread dough. The aroma of banana blends easily with those notes of yeast and bread. Sadly though, there is no presence of clove which you would expect from a beer of this type. The finish is delicate and only very slightly grassy in nature.
Flavor starts off with an almost citrusy tartness, something reminiscent of Seville oranges, maybe. Flavors of yeast and fresh baked bread come through at this point. As with the nose, this is where I find flavors of banana blending seamlessly with that yeasty, fresh baked bread. Carbonation is soft and spritzy, helping highlight this beer’s delicate flavors. The finish is only slightly grassy, before fading into the background.
It would be all too easy to describe this weissbier as being bland, or lacking in character. I think it’s more apt to describe it as delicate, maybe a good introduction level weissbier. This might be a classic example of a beer to give someone who’s never had this kind of beer before.Apr 20, 2021"

The bottle states this is the ""World's No. 1 Hefe-Weizen."" While that may simply be marketing hyperbole, the overall mild, inoffensive flavor may very well make it so. That is not to say it is forgettable, only that in the world of fine German wheat ales, it falls toward the bottom.

Chimay Blue,3.75,4.0,4.5,4.5,"Appearance:
An angry sea of coral brown froth, gushes over the lip of the glass; beneath it, a depth of murky molasses brown. Retention is shockingly short, given the Vesuvial geyser the ale emits.

Bouquet:
A bulwark of Belgian yeast under a drizzle of brown rice syrup, precariously propped up on a tripod of wheat bread. A heel of browned, beer bread, sparsely pocked with raisins emerges late in the after-aroma.

Feel:
Elegant, plush medium draped in a sprawling shawl of carbonation that keeps those baking spice flavors alive and signing. The linger is semi-sweet and bears a gentle touch of booze heat.

Taste:
A gregarious greeting of Belgian yeast spiciness arrives, toting a tray of caramelized plantains, carefully dusted with cardamom, cloves, and allspice. Introductions are rounded out by crumbs of Boston brown bread and a warming, boozy, “boop” on the tongue.Jul 28, 2021"

So, this is something of a classic beer we have here. That being said, my usual store doesn't carry it, so I was thrilled to see it while I was visiting New York! Realistically I could have found it at a different store closer to me, but I figured I might as well grab it anyways. I'm thrilled to try this one

Pours an opaque deep brown with 3 fingers of fluffy light tan head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

The nose here is intoxicating, if not a bit simple for what it is. I'm picking up on aromas of plump raisin, brown sugar, overripe banana, brown bread, and toffee

It's definitely more spice forward in taste, but finds a nice balance between spice and fruity yeast. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dark malt, black pepper, rich caramel, plum, and a touch of earthy hops. The swallow brings it back to more familiar territory, bringing notes of raisin, apple skin, toasted malt, candi sugar, and a touch of clove

A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a surprisingly refreshing and light beer for the abv. Finishes mostly dry with a nice sweetness

S: It is well developed and the yeast did lots of work. The nose resembles candied prunes, par for the course of Belgian strong ale.

F- Rich deep and pungent and yet very smooth. Would make a great winter-time slow-sipping beer for the evening, or to accompany dessert.
O- Very nice, nothing seems at all out of place though overall it's arguably a bit of a blunt instrument which would benefit from more definable characteristics. The ABV% is also arguably a bit loud-and-proud given the 9% here is pretty full-on, but shouldn't be coming over as quite such a boozy brute.

Taste: Brown sugar, plums and raisins.

This beer begs to be sipped by a fire on a cold winters night. The lack of smell is a significant weak point IMHO considering the beers worldwide reputation. My least favorite of the Belgian Quads on offer at the LCBO. For me it earns a B+Oct 06, 2020"

S - Heavy malt and bread on the nose. Clean and earthy.

T - Caramel, malt, barley, bread, yeast, coffee, and raisin notes come through quite profoundly; malt and barley being at the forefront specifically. This is a very complex beer. In the front of the palette this ale seems slightly sour and bitter. Though, in the back of the palette, this ale seems sweet. This offering is interesting and mysterious. 

M - Pleasantly full yet non-lingering. This brew is dry but refreshing. 

D - I wouldn't consider this a session beer due to its higher alcohol content. However, this is a very easy drinking ale considering its high ABV.

Yeah, it might seem boring to some lager professionals, but as a normal Jo Bloggs lager lout, I once took a trip to Berlin Beer Festival, and tasted many great lagers along the long line of tents, but was still impressed by this classic brew when I reached their massive tent at the end.

Very malty, like all good German beers, string aroma, highly carbonated. As I said, you can often find even better beer on tap in the Ratskellers all over Germany, but if anyone wants to know what a good German beer should taste like, this is the product they should try.May 06, 2019"

Lowenbrau Original,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Oh man, we are making history change now! We are finally rewriting those dark pages of our sad past when we had to drink these beers made in Hungary. Some of the German or Austrian beers for some reason were made in Hungary, only for the Hungarian market. It meant that we were left with crappy, corny beer and I never liked beer back home because of this. Of course I hated Löwenbrau too, for being that bad of a beer.
And then, decades later, only recently I learned that those beers were only made in Hungary ""after the original licence"" - so I was eager to try the real ones! It wasn't rwally a quest but every time I came across the originals I gave them a shot. And found that they were much better than the p*ss that we used to be drinking.
This original Löwenbrau is just the same. It has no corn, no sickening yeast, no low quality ingredients, no sharp overcarbonation. It is actually quite okay! Here you can imagine that this is actually a real beer and you start feeling the ingredients in there as well.
At the same time however, halfway through you start recognizing the hints of the hops and malts that we in Hungary tried to reproduce and which lead to this terrible taste. I slightly feel that in here too, although not to a sickening extent.
So what I can say: it was great to finally try the original of this and it's much better than what I've known. But as a boring german lager, sorry but it will never be my favorite.

P.S.: it’s pretty ironic that now when I’m adding this post scriptum to my review a couple of years later (2021) I feel that this beer is pretty decent. Maybe it is because I’m in Japan and the beers here are a far cry from what you would like to call a “decent beer...”
So I had to edit my evaluation and rate this one up a bit. It smells quite hoppy and tastes refreshing, no bitterness, no aftertaste whatsoever, it’s all oh-so-positive! Not sure if there’s anything different or if it’s just me, but this was the best Löwenbrau that I’ve ever had (the can was white and golden though, instead of the classic light blue...)
Anyway, never too late to rewerite history, huh?Jun 22, 2018"

Guinness Original,4.0,4.5,5.0,5.0,"This is considered the original, the one that started it all the way back over 200 years, in 1821. The one that was popular and mostly drank as late as the 1970s, the one your grandfather or great grand-father would have drank!

The can has a retro look about it, with the iconic harp logo and explaining that this beer will be “Dark and Lively”. Strength varies in where you are drinking it. In the UK and Ireland it is 4.2% but in Europe it is over 5%, jammy bastards. 

Bottle conditioned and carbonate with C02, so no ball or nitro here……

Did a silly pour for the first pint, no care just straight in, which resulted in a massive head, which eventually settled down. All creamy and dark in the colour.

Second pour more considered and with care, but still made no difference, still got a massive amount of carbonation with a huge head that takes a while to settle. Much more lively than a regular Guinness. Big frothy tanned head, black is the colour. When settled its not bad on the eye. Good lacing remains on glass. 

On the nose I get the typical Guinness aroma, stouty and peaty, chocolate and caramel. Actually I would go as far to say it is even more “peaty” than the regular Guinness. Does smell authentic, roasted barley, grainy, malty and smoked peat. Nice smell, with a lot of character…..

Onto the taste, well first off it has the expected Guinness feel in the mouth, very typical of the famous stout. Get the roasted barley and malts, the coffee and chocolate flavours, But there is more to it than that, there definitely is a nod to the old style with this brew, feels more porter in the taste, and the flavours are more to the fore, thanks to a higher ratio of hops than the regular Guinness. 

Great to drink, has a real character to it, and I love the coffee flavours swirling around in the mouth, brilliant stuff. 

When I bought a few of these cans, my sister immediately laughed saying I bought into the gimmick. It’s not like Guinness to bring out a million different versions of essentially the same thing, their famous draught stout. She thought it was a slightly more “expensive version” of the same thing. To be fair I was half expecting that too! But no, I can state there is a CLEAR difference with this to the draught. It is softer on the palate, very well balanced, has more flavouring, is tastier, and one doesn’t get that bloated feeling you get when you drink a lot of the regular Guinness. 

Liked it a lot, very satisfying and easy to drink and I WILL return again for future inspection. Recommended. 

I have started to think maybe the regular Guinness isn’t in fact the master, the number one, perhaps the original, the Extra Stout, should be my go to Stout in the future…….oh dear, what a dilemma. The draught is creamier, tastier, much smoother and fun to drink, while the Extra Stout just has that better flavour and more to pack and think about, and perhaps is the better beer of the two……..oh I don’t know!!!Apr 13, 2021"

Overall: It is a great tasting stout. The label states that this is ""GUINNESS EXTRA STOUT"" and that the beer is ""5.6% ALC./VOL."" The beer has a lot of flavor and it is satisfying to drink. It simply looks amazing in the glass as well. The beer tastes very fresh but I have no import information that I can readily see on the bottle. I would recommend it to stout lovers and it would be difficult to find one that wouldn't enjoy this given how much fresh flavor is packed into it. I would drink it again.Feb 13, 2021"
Guinness Original,5.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,"I'm still getting into the more complex beers like guinness but I still love it. It's somewhat strong in taste if you're not use to stouts but not to strong. It's definitely bittersweet with coffee and some chocolate flavor but it finishes up nice and smooth. A solid beer that's leagues above the average American budweiser coors or Miller. Still one of my favorites to get at my local gas stationFeb 03, 2021"
Guinness Original,4.0,3.75,3.75,3.5,"January 17, 2021 - I had Guinness Stout several years ago and didn't think much of it. It was flat. Someone suggested that that was because of it having been shipped across the Atlantic, so I went to England and tried it there. It seemed the same there as here. So now I have tried a number of stouts and porters and a couple of them have become favorites. I thought I would try Guinness again, to see if my opinion would change. 

Dark, opaque. The tan head recedes quickly to a cap; The smell is mild and pleasant; Flavor is rich and tasty; Mouthfeel is better than I recall for the regular Guinness stout I had tasted before; Overall, not bad, but a little on the weak side. Nice flavor, mediocre mouthfeel.

January 18, 2021 - Next day. Opened a bottle. having lunch with family. Drinking right out of the bottle, didn't even notice it until I was halfway through. This is a session stout. At ABV 5.6% its only a little higher than most session ales. Anyhow, no objections whatsoever, I'll finish the six with no regrets.

February 28, 2021 - I like its look: dark with a tan head. it recedes to a cap. The smell is good; the taste is good. I raised the points for look, smell, and taste by .25. The feel, and therefore the overall, is not awful, but somewhat mediocre.Jan 18, 2021"
Guinness Original,4.0,4.0,4.25,4.25,"Maybe by quantitative stands this is not a truly great beer, but I love it. In the old days this was the most interesting beer that was readily available. Put that together with a wonderful anniversary trip to Ireland and tracking down the local Guinness (albeit a sugary mess) in Africa, and this will always have a sentimental place as a personal favorite. Thick, creamy head if you pour it right. The lingering lacing reveals every long drink. Smoky, malty, smooth, and delicious. The dry finish is key to the balance, staving off the sweetness that plagues some stouts.Jan 10, 2021"
Guinness Original,4.0,3.75,4.0,4.0,"Look: Pitch black on the pour with a huge, billowing tan head that pillows up nicely, slowly pulling back to reveal great lacing
Aroma: Warm brown bread, a little smoked peat, roast, some earthy notes, and wafts of cocoa
Taste: Rich bready malt, cocoa, and roast strike first with earthiness and light smoked peat joining in soon after. Bread and roast hold down the bulk of the middle and closes with nice dark chocolate and earthiness
Mouthfeel: Full, medium-high carbonation, smooth on initial hit and finish, and very clean on the finish as well
Overall: This is delicious stuff. A true classic and though I drink it several times a year, hadn’t had it in a bit, and was drawn to the 19.2oz can I saw while grocery shopping so couldn’t resist. A well-made Irish Stout that checks all the right boxes per style and a tasty one at that. If for some reason you haven’t had it before or yet, do yourself a favorDec 26, 2020"
Guinness Original,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,"Pours a very dark brown with a creamy tan head that dissipates after about a minute. The smell has slightly dark coffee and honey with hints of toffee and chocolate on the finish. The taste is very smooth slightly dark chocolate, but not as dark and intense as I was expecting. The finish is perfectly bitter and goes down smoothly. I can understand why it would be easy to pound a bunch of these. Overall very very good.Dec 24, 2020"
Guinness Original,4.0,4.0,4.25,4.0,"I was looking for a less expensive beer with a little less alcohol than the somewhat expensive stouts I have been enjoying --and tried this by chance. And I tried it again and again. It has a really nice balance and character to suit me even though I prefer the rich, thick Imperial Stouts, but then I can save a few buck before and after the ones scoring 95. In relative terms, I think this is closer to a 90 score than an 85.Nov 26, 2020"
Guinness Original,4.5,3.75,4.0,3.25,"LOOK - - - super dark / black - decent khaki colored foam - head retention average - nice lacing

TASTE - - - a lot of bitterness upfront - heavily roasted dark grains - charred wood and scorched molasses - some caramel
FEEL - - - feels a bit thin / in the medium bodied range - expected a stout to be fuller
OVERALL - - - a tasty stout but there's a lot of 'over cooked / over roasted' flavors here - still enjoyable and wouldn't mind drinking once in awhileNov 01, 2020"
Guinness Original,4.0,2.75,3.0,3.5,"L: A classic stout. Very dark reddish brown, almost pitch black. Soapy tan head, nothing compared to the towering pillows you get with the nitro or can version.
S: Pretty faint. Roasted yet bready malt, some coffee. Like a stout, just very faint.
T: As expected. Malty, a bit liquorice-y, hints of umami... Tastes a bit bigger than what it is. A bit less dry than the nitro version.
F: Medium body medium carbonation with a dry finish.
O: A good commercial stout. A wholly different beast than the Guinness from the can or from the nitro tap but still very good and enjoyable. You could definitely quaff it if you wanted to. I can't rate it higher because there are plenty of better stouts around but if a bar is carrying this and adjunct lager, I know what I'll be ordering, and worth getting a six-pack from the supermarket every other week.

Schmucker Hefeweizen,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,"Light banana, cloves, whole wheat bread and yeast on the nose. Typical weizen flavor profile is at play here, with sweet banana being the lead suspect.

Medium to full-bodied, nice tongue-tickling medium carbonation, with a nice creamy mouthfeel.Mar 26, 2016"
Schmucker Hefeweizen,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,"Easily pours a 2.5 finger head, off-white in color, with plenty of fluff to it and slight lacing. Nice murky amber color with a mild wheat/yeast nose. Fruity, citrusy and slightly peppery on first taste with a light, silky body. Quite refreshing, actually. Not a hugely complex wheat beer, but would certainly be appreciated on a hot summer’s day. Strangely, I couldn’t detect any of the sweetness that the reviewers mentioned. Perhaps for me this manifested itself in the overall fruitiness of the drink.Dec 04, 2012"
Schmucker Hefeweizen,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,"Opalescent orange-yellow apperance, good carbonation. Bautiful white foam, creamy, well done.

Correct weizen, even in the taste, with the classic notes of cloves, banana and yeast.
A bit of sweetness again the aftertaste, banana, light cloves.

Schmucker Hefeweizen,5.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,"This brew pours with massive amounts of head with a sligthly vigorous pour. The body is quite hazy and is golden orange in color.

Fragrances I detect are mostly banana with a slight bubble gum aroma.

This tastes very sweet. The flavor is dominated by banana for sure.

This is a pretty good weizen, but a little too sweet and not totally well balancedSep 28, 2007"
Schmucker Hefeweizen,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,"Found this in a very fancy grocery store in one of the swankest parts of town (yes, Moscow can be swank). Standard German brown half liter bottle with a blue and silver label featuring a guy in a pirate hat holding a mug of beer. Purity law, of course, and a lot of emphasis on pure springs. Best before 9/7/05, I opened it on 12/12/04.

Pours a very cloudy yellow gold under a firm two finger snow white head that settles very slowly but leaves next to no lace at all. The nose is very, very yeasty, with some wheat but not much spice or citrus. Interesting. The mouth is very prickly and slightly sticky/heavy. The taste leaves a smooth and mild impression, very much dominated by the yeast. There's really no noticeable spice or fruit here, and no hops either. This is a good case study in what yeast tastes like, but not exactly a balanced or complex product.Dec 12, 2004"
Red Dog,3.75,3.75,4.0,3.75,"(12 oz can, APR 2020; bought cold single at local basic liquors... poured into a 14 oz mug)

L: inch-high foam on pour, sitting atop a polished-clear, brass-colored liquid; the foam is actually relatively dense and glossy, receding surprisingly slow... holds a half-moon crescent collar and, dang, if there isn't 3-4 thick bands of lace - huh?

S: very pale, almost flour-like, vaguely corn-flaky grain smell dominates, mellow toasted note; mildly grassy-herbal overtone

T: apple juicy ester(?) up front, with a sudden surge of cereal-like (again, corn flakes), dried grassy/earthy grain midway; finishes rather dry with a mild lingering pils malt husk note, maybe a slight background tinge of masa; moderately bitter for its ilk

F: certainly a vibrant effervescence, bubbling and rumbling the center of each sip, with a few healthy belches as proof... the body itself is on the meatier side of light

O: first time having this in perhaps 25 years, last time being likely a lukewarm can awash in a sea of melting ice in a cooler at a gathering in the woods (or one of my other many haunts)... had no recollection of this being a Miller product, but given my inclination toward their brands, I could honestly see getting this again, even, just maybe, a 30 pack (I've seen em) (1722)Jan 08, 2021"
Red Dog,2.75,2.75,3.0,4.5,"Pours a translucent gold like any other aal with a white head that dissipates immediately. Smells like wet grain with a touch of just enough hops to let you know it's not a light beer. Taste is surprisingly better than most with a less apparent adjunct presence than other macros. This one shines because it doesn't lie. It's uncommonly smooth. This goes down maybe even easier than water. Overall an exceptional aal but I've only seen it once. Get it if you can.Oct 28, 2020"

Red Dog,2.0,3.0,3.5,3.25,"Drank from a 12 ounce can. Score is based on the style.

Look - Weird and scatterbrained. The light background picture of the Plank Road Brewery building is on a weird slant, as is the bulldog picture, which is on par with all the millions of high school bulldog mascot pictures. The claim of ""uncommonly smooth"" is bold, and I wonder just how true it'll be.

Smell - Yep, smells like a beer. Very corny with that air of wet grain. Nothing much of note here, but nothing bad either.

Taste - The essence of beer. Like the smell, it's exactly what comes to mind when you think AAL. Very mild and balanced, sweet but not overly sweet, just enough earthiness without tasting dirty. Don't think I'd ever turn down a can if I was offered one.

Feel - Surprisingly little carbonation with a light-medium body. It truly is uncommonly smooth.

Overall - A random cheap beer that's good and hasn't been picked up by the hipster crowd yet? This is a true rarity.Feb 05, 2019"
Red Dog,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0," ounce can into lager glass, best before 6/4/2018. Pours crystal clear medium golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light corn/pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. A touch of fruity aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice and pleasant aromas with pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light corn/pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light corn/pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Light-moderate increasing dryness from bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5%. Overall this is a nice pale adjunct lager. All around nice obustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. Very flavorful and not watery for the ABV. Very clean pale malt/grain flavors, and nice earthy hop presence for the style. Really nice barley presence, and not overdone on adjuncts at all. A nicely enjoyable offering, and well made style example as expected of Miller.May 12, 2018"
Red Dog,2.75,2.5,2.0,2.25,"Appearance – Clear yellow beer with a thin layer of head.

The color is a straw yellow. Carbonation was practically non-existent. The nose was basically like corn meets the smell of cut grass; that was sitting in the lawnmower over the weekend. Taste... well, there is a reason that this beer is weak. The taste was water mixed with a bland element of corn flakes. Very little else. Sad. Mouthfeel is watery with nearly no carbonation. Overall, not a strong beer.Aug 29, 2017"
Red Dog,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,"Pours a golden straw yellow. Thick creamy head that dissipates quickly. Smells of corn and not really much else. Tastes almost the same with a very watery mouthfeel. What can I say about the beer that everyone has had? It's not good. It's not even really bad. But it's a throwback to the 90's and tastes more of nostalgia than flavor. Not really good for a hearty tasting event, but if you are just looking to drink cheaply tonight, this beer is for you.Jul 30, 2017"

Start this of with a shot of Early Times to ""cleanse the palate"". Lets crack this can into a lager mug., to see the sights!...Typical pale gold lager. Grainy, faint metallic aroma.

I threw this in the freezer for 20 minutes out of the garage. So far, light, smooth on the tongue. I remember seeing the billboards in Madison before this came out, of course the bulldog caught my eye. It was popular around town for a bit. So far, so good, Nothing spectacular, but easy drinking. Letting it warm a bit. Nice to drink from the 24. Nice touch of sweetness, but just a bit, very smooth, low carbonation.

I suppose the Big Bad Dog is to conger up thoughts of manly drinking but real men don't drink labels, real men drink what they like. This stuff is lightly colored, lightly flavored (what flavor there is) and is beer by definition only.

Most beer I have drank over the years is a pale or medium dark yellow. The pour was what I was expecting. The head did dissipate quickly, but I personally prefer that...never been one to like the foamy taste of beer. 

The smell was a beer smell. Grains and hops. Yeah, buddy. The taste was light from the moment it hit my mouth and finished very smooth. How smooth? I like Natural Ice a lot and I drink it quite slowly. Red Dog was to smooth for it to be my regular beer because I ended up hammering it. Before I knew it I had drank 4 of them in the space of 90 minutes and was nicely toasted.

My attitude toward beer is the same when I was smoking, I don't spend a lot for my vices. You spent $25 for a premium brand name and got one case? I spent the same amount and got 2 30 packs of Red Dog... and a case and a half more.

I like the taste. I lived in Wisconsin for over 40 years. Maybe the beer that you compare to your local beer is a required taste. I drank MGD for years. It is not as good as MGD, but it is good by itself.Jan 09, 2016"

When I was younger I remember the advertising for it, but that's neither here nor there. Avoid this as if it were the bubonic plague. The head dissipated into nothing moments after I poured it into my glass, nary a lace to be had.

Red Dog,3.75,2.0,3.25,3.0,"Had this back in the day, and this may be one of the only macro adjuncts I've never reviewed. So I bought a six pack of cans for $4 and here we are. 

Appearance : Pale straw golden body, mostly transparent. The head is nice on this beer, and stays around awhile. I'm measuring two fingers, and eventually it dwindles down to a very foamy ring. Delicate and sparse lacing on the sides of the glass.

Aroma : Like any typical miller off-brand lager. Much like Milwaukee's Best. Lots of corn, chemical, clean water, faint hop leaf, skunk. 

Taste : It's actually not bad. A light baked grain flavor hits first, followed by some faint vegetal hop, and ends crisp and a little bready with biscuit and crust. It leaves a dried pilsner flavor on the palate. 

Mouthfeel : Light bodied, very carbonated, ends slightly pasty and dry. 

Overall : For $3.99 it's a decent beer. I wouldn't spend much more than that on it though. At this point to me it's better than High Life. It's got some toasted bread crust flavors and I like that. Try it, you might just like it.Mar 27, 2015"
Coedo Shiro,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,"Poured from 330mL bottle into a tulip. Bottled on 9/11/17.

Appearance: light golden hue with a relatively light haze for the style. Head is a finger of frothy white foam with moderate retention. Not too bad.

Smell: sweetish malt with a little bit of wheat character but not much of the banana/clove aroma that really charactertizes the style.

Taste: malty, again, with some wheat character but not really anything of the yeasty banana and clove flavor that makes the style so appealing. For a ""pale wheat ale"", it's pretty good, but for a ""German hefeweizen"", it's lacking a bit.

Mouthfeel: medium body with a good carbonation and creaminess.

Overall: this is not a bad beer by any means. But it lacks some of what makes a good German hefeweizen. I am still enjoying drinking this.Sep 10, 2019"
Coedo Shiro,3.0,3.5,3.25,2.5,"Poured into a small hefe glass. Head was thin and dissipated quickly. Slightly cloudy. Smells like a weak version of your classic Hefeweizen. Taste is unfortunately pretty weak too, with some notes of cloves and bananas. Feel is where this beer fails. Flat and thin on the front end. What happened to the carbonation? No aftertaste to speak of. Watery yet dry. I thought I’d give this a try because hey, it’s a Japanese take on a German classic. Nice try, Japan, but better stick to lagers.Jul 02, 2019"
Coedo Shiro,4.0,3.75,3.5,4.25,"Never heard of this beer or brewery before. Having it on-tap with lunch with my dad at Crossroads Cafe in 29 Palms, CA on our vacation. Served in a standard pint glass, this beer is a mostly cloudy/hazy, light golden color with a white head that's about an inch thick when first served to me. Head a fairly thick ring lining the inside of the glass along with some decent lacing. Some bready malts, wheat and certainly hints of banana and clove are present. A very similar flavor profile, with some bready malts, wheat and certainly hints of banana and clove and a trace of floral hops. Not at all a bad flavor profile, but the clove and banana were not pronounced enough for this style of beer. Has a crisp, yet smooth and slightly frothy, medium to full bodied mouth feel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish and a nice, slightly bready and wheaty aftertaste.

Coedo Shiro,3.25,4.0,3.75,3.25,"Got at Woodman's in Kenosha on a beer run to Wisconsin to find brewers with the good sense not to do business with the Illinois ABC. The haul always includes New Glarus and, this time, Coedo. My first from them.

Being brewers of rice and not malt, the longevity issue for Coedo is how well can they copy the German styles and stay stable enough to get from Japan to the Great Lakes. This hefe is more than OK and given its travel to the Midwest, probably above the average American crafters rendition. 

I must say its Looks are not promising, quickly goes flat and never really gets cloudy. But Smells make up for it; Coedo seems to know how to get those smells out of the yeast... not easy to copy banana and clove together. Taste come in good but not well; here too, it is a good copy. Feel falls a bit flat, thin and not lasting.

I will continue this analysis with the other two German styles I purchased.

8/8/20 Edited the above review. Three years later, I buy another copy.. also almost a year old. Still an enjoyable hefe-, but probably not one worth having a third time. But just in case, I will keep count over at UnTappd.Aug 21, 2017"

Coedo Shiro,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,"30ml bottle poured into a 350ml beer glass.

Poured a dark, cloudy yellow. Not much of a head or lacing.

Nose - nIce aromas and failry typical of the style. Yeasty with bubble gum, cloves a hint of banana.

Palate - again, fairly typical. Quite complex but not too cloying or sticky with a hint of bitterness in the finish.

Fairly good mouth. Quite full and well rounded. 

I've been finding a lot of heffes a bit bland and/or cloying and sticky lately. I thought maybe I was just going off the style but this is very nice.

Overall, a very refreshing and sessionable heffe. Good exanple.

Coedo Shiro,4.75,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Gotta swim against the tide a bit here, as this thing absolutely sang for me. Maybe it was having it fresh on draught. Maybe it was the killer seafood alongside, courtesy of Bear Flag Fish Co. Whatever the case, this was a delight to look at in the glass, a rim of white foam atop a glowing deep gold nectary body, rich with haze and irresistible effervescence. Nose is oodles of banana, with a touch of spice, almost ginger-like (but maybe my mind is making connections with the Japanese brewer there), light wheat twang that grows in stature as the glass wears on. Flavor is rich banana again, sweet, inviting, delicious. It maybe gets a touch too sweet as it goes, but this is a minor qualm. Body felt a-ok to me, appropriately bubbly, definitely wet rather than dry, but I thought that worked to its benefit, accentuating the decadence of the brew. Overall, this was a home run, and I'd love an encore to see if it holds up.Sep 10, 2015"
Coedo Shiro,2.0,3.75,3.5,3.5,"Pretty unacceptable head action for a hefeweizen; it hardly even appears. The body is an evenly, lightly hazed gold.

Smells very true to style, with a massive banana aroma (and some pineapple) with a bit of clove as well, although that comes through more in the flavor than the smell. What else to say? It's textbook. Fairly light, dry, low hop aroma and bitterness, and overall quite pleasant. But definitely not better than the German originals.Sep 05, 2015"
Coedo Shiro,4.0,3.75,3.5,3.0,"Thick golden cloud with a storm of yeast brewing within. Two fingers of melting whipped cream floats on top and disappears as on a hot day. Too dense to notice any carbonation.

Bananas, caramel and cloves are hinted with creme brûlée. 

Bananas, fresh apple cider and a hint of caramel make me go ""Wha what!!"" in contrast to first appearances.

Light watery body, moderate fine bubbled carbonation.

Proud to see this brewed in Asia. Just not an overwhelming representation of the style as done in Germany. Bought in Chiang Mai, drank July 12th, 2015.Jul 12, 2015"
Coedo Shiro,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.5,"Packaged on: 6/27/14.

Pours a murky light whitish-brown with a foamy tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is subdued with some wheat, banana, and spice aromas. Taste is much the same with grain, caramel, banana, and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with decent aromas, but the taste is slightly better in terms of traditional hefeweizen qualities.

Serving type: bottle.Nov 24, 2014"
Coedo Shiro,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,"A: Pours some dramatic bubbling effect at first, but ends in a 1/2 inch of bubbles that quickly dissipates to zero. The carbonation is very light, but very active. The golden yellow appearance has a beautiful slightly darker orange cloudy center in my glass. 

S: I taste a strong wheat beer, with banana, and clove. 

T: A great hefeweizen - strong flavors of banana, and clove, and wheat, i almost get a hint of a grapefruit at the end. 

M: Very thin and watery, but a refreshing and active amount of gentle carbonation. 

O: The taste of this beer is awesome, it's very enjoyable to taste, but the mouthfeel is way too watery. Aftertaste is a bit bitter, the other components aren't sweet enough to balance it out.Dec 04, 2013"
Coedo Shiro,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,"A: The beer is relatively clear dark yellow in color and has no visible carbonation. It poured with a ¼-finger high head that quickly dissipated, leaving only a thing collar around the edge of the glass and some wispy lacing on the surface.
S: There are moderate to strong aromas of bananas in the nose along with notes of bubble gum.
T: The taste is almost identical to the smell and has lots of flavors of bananas and bubble gum.
M: It feels light- to medium-bodied on the palate and has a low to moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This beer has a great smell and taste but is lacking in carbonation, particularly in the appearance.Oct 10, 2012"
Coedo Shiro,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,"A: Pours a lightly hazy medium golden yellow in color with some orange highlights and moderate amounts of visible carbonation. The beer has a quarter finger tall bubbly white head that quickly reduces to a couple of small patches of large bubbles and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Light amounts of lacing are observed.

S: Moderate aromas of wheat, banana, clove, and lemon citrus. Lighter hints of bubblegum.

T: A really good tasting hefeweizen - moderately strong flavors of banana, clove, and wheat with a slightly ligher presence of lemon citrus.

M: Light to medium bodied with moderate to heavy amounts of gentle carbonation. Slightly thin/watery.

O: The smell and the taste of this beer are spot on for the style but the appearance and mouthfeel are not quite spot on... Very enjoyable and easy to drink, easily sessionable.Oct 07, 2012"
Coedo Shiro,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"My second ever Japanese crafted beer. (Sapporo, Kirin and Asahi do not count!)

A: Nice cloudy straw colour. After two or three minutes the head vanishes.

S: Rubbery at first, but actually turns out to be very nice. Banana and spice.

T: Not half bad. Sweet, lots of banana but just on the right side of palatable/sickly. A bit more effervescence would take it a lot further, but the flavour is spot on. Not much bubblegum.

M: Body strength spot on but it's the flattest hefewiezen I've ever had, as in it's almost entirely flat, and I can't work out if I like that or not. Maybe not.

O: Very underrated, but again, I really feel it would benefit from some more effervescence. All in all good job, Coedo, but stop copying Chimay's label design!!!Aug 27, 2012"

A - Pours the classic Heffe,cloudy hay like colour. Small White head that disappears quickly.

S - Small amounts of yeast and sticky bread

T - Up front some nice malty flavours but fades badly after that.

O - Not the best Hefe and there are much better examplesMar 02, 2012"
Coedo Shiro,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,"A-Pours hazy light amber with a ring of eggshell white bubbles.

S-Cloves, white pepper, banana peels. Bubble gum sweetness.

T/M-Light/medium bodied with light, unobtrusive carbonation and a lingering bubblegum sweetness in the finish. A by the book hefeweizen. Could use some more aggressive prickly carbonation to bring out the pepper/clove flavors and cut the sweetness. 

O-An average interpretation of the style.Aug 11, 2011"
Coedo Shiro,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,"Poured from the bottle into a collins glass. Served a little colder than expected at the sushi joint I was at.

A cloudy off yellow/orange body. Head does not stay at all but is off white colored. It manages to maintain a collar throughout drinking but there is no head action on this beer whatsoever.

Bouquet is wheat and simple yeast, with chewy spice profile. Faint hint of ginger, but it seems like a wet beer is coming, not very dynamic. No sense of clove or banana.

Taste is a wet bodied and watery lemon, muted wheat and airy spritzy feeling. It certainly tastes like a Heffeweizen, but it's quite watery in mouthfeel.

Still overall this is pretty easy drinking, and depending on the price I could drink this compared to some other mass produced beers. There is certainly better for this style out there but I could have this again no problem.Mar 31, 2011"
Coedo Shiro,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,"Purchased from a Japanese supermarket in a unique bottle with creative letters raised on glass of the neck.

A - An average hay color. Some reasonable head, close to 1 finger. And even some continued carbonation. A slightly cloudy haze to the beer.

S - Also average for a Hefeweizen. Some sweet sour citrus yeast smells mixed with a splash of wheatyness.

T - Initial sour twang that you expect some faint fruity estery tones and a standard hop. A Hoegaarden clone.

M - A bit too loose, as is common in Japanese micro brews. Maybe a result of sugars or rice in the process.

D - This is a fine off the shelf Hefeweizen and pretty good for a larger Japanese micro brew. This is an attempt to compete with the recent popularity of Hoegaarden.Jan 16, 2010"
Coedo Shiro,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,"3cl bottle from a random Japanese market.

Pours a hazy golden-straw color with a one-finger off-white head and some sediment at the bottom.

Aroma is fairly typical for the style: wheat, yeast, banana, and citrus.

Flavor is wheaty and yeasty with banana, clove, and lemon. Something is a little weird on the finish - maybe this beer is less than fresh.

Fairly light body with a mild astringency on the palate.

Drinkability is above average. Overall this is a pretty average hefeweizen.Jan 02, 2010"
Damburger Export,3.75,3.0,2.0,3.5,"Poured from a pint can into a pint glass. 

A-Golden yellow lager, bubbly and carbonated; a nice white creamy 1/2 inch white head that shrunk to a creamy white surface along the top of the beer, which stuck around the whole time I nursed the beer. A lot of sticky lace left on the glass. 

S-Pretty standard for a lager; light, crisp, grainy, clean smelling sweet malt. Almost adjunct-esque but not too much. 

T-Initially going in was light, wet, and fresh. As I began swishing the beer on my palate I began to sense a strong metallic/irony flavor. I am not sure if it was suppose to be that way. The enjoy by date says 3/2014. The aftertaste left the metallic flavor in the back of my throat, along with some sweet malt, light spice from the hops, and perhaps some grains. As the beer warmed, the metallic taste dissipated a little...however, it never completely went away. I tasted a little spice, which would have been nice if the irony taste wasn't there. Also as the beer warmed the aftertaste was a little dry and perhaps a hint of clove spice. Disappointed overall with the taste. 

M-light, carbonated, and refreshing; nice body. Tasted like a better lager with more flavor. 

Overall, if the metallic/irony taste wasn't there I would have rated this beer higher. Too bad.Nov 07, 2013"
Damburger Export,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Poured from a 300 ml bottle. 
Pours a golden yellow colour, with minimal bubbles floating and a 2 finger white, soapy head that becomes just a line of foam on the surface of the beer a whil later.
It has a strong smell of malts and hops.
Taste is typical for a lager, but there are some traces of corn too, thankfully not very noticeable.
On the palate is medium carbonated and thin.

Looks very nice in the glass. Crystal clear golden yellow body with streams of carbonation. Bright white head lasts until halfway through, good scattered lacing initially.

Musty, moldy aroma. Quite unpleasant.

Fortunately, the aroma doesn't translate to the taste. Sweet and malty, a little grain, no discernable hop prescence. Decent carbonation level.

Mouth medium, finish slightly dry with a bit of an aftertaste.

Efes Pilsener,3.25,2.75,3.75,3.5,"00ml bottle, bb in 8m.

Clear light golden colour, very thin head that disappears quickly, no lace. Bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass instead, almost as in a sparkling wine.

Non-assertive nose from the sweeter end of the Eurolager spectrum. The faintest hop notes, a dash of grain, but for some reason I am reminded of maize. Not very promising.

Taste is an improvement, there is a weak but clear sense of a diacetyl-type pilsener (which I like), so this is more a pilsener than a pils. Too bad hops are missing almost totally. There is the bitterness in the tail, clearer if you eat something sweetish (sampled in a Turkish restaurant). The carbonation is a distractor, being so sharpish and bringing a soapy element. 

As such, somewhat above average for a Euro lager. Fits very well with Turkish food based on this experience. The flavours of the food make the beer drier and the carbonation has the counterpoints to complete.Feb 01, 2020"
Efes Pilsener,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"I had a draft of this at a Turkish restaurant in Chicago on New Year's eve...the last day of 2017. It was OK, but nothing spectacular.

L: crystal-clear pale gold liquid; yes, a bit of dusty sediment snuck in, suspended; inch-high, bumpy pad of white foam... thin collar remains, only a few thin strands of lace

S: pungent herbal hop-forward punch, perhaps a touch of sulfur; underlying doughy malt lingers

T: bready malt base; grassy, spicy hop a bit on the decline, but adds a nice herbal bitterness on the back end; clean, dry aftertaste... subsequent sips reinforce a doughy malt foundation, slight golden bread crust settling in the wings, subtle spicy phenol at the back; flavors overall relatively rich

F: smooth, light-plus body; barely a sizzle going through... a little chew, but otherwise lovely, clean, mellow malt nectar; faint glow of warmth builds in the back

O: took a chance on this - my other option locally was a 6-pack sitting in a pile in the back room of Mr. Liquor, each bottle with a beard (c. 2014s?)... I do believe I had this once out of a green longneck, at least 10 years ago, swilled from the bottle (a common theme with many international pale lagers, first encounter)... despite apparent age, this wasn't half bad (1590)Oct 24, 2019"

Taste. Same as the smell. Just not a lot going on here besides the corn sweetness.

Nice dense soapy lacing clings down the glass, with as fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. A bit of skunky aromas, that dissipate through the glass, not overwhelming. Nice aromas with pale malts and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, floral, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish.

Very nice robustness and balance of pale malts and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with no fruity/yeasty notes present. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth and moderately bready/grainy/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5%. Overall this is a very good Euro pale lager. All around nice robustness and balance of pale malts and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the modestly bitter/drying finish.

Efes Pilsener,3.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,"Poured from a single serve into a pils glass.

Pours a remarkably pale straw color with a quick rising (and just as quickly leaving) two-finger foamy head. An initial storm of big bubble gives way to lower carbonation. Looks like a typical AAL.

The aromas are much better than the look. There is an undeniable adjunct character, with plenty of grain, but not offputting, and other aromas including grass, lemon, honey and earthy notes appear.

The taste is a ""push"" of good and not so much. Surprisingly balanced with a pleasing sweetness mixed with a definite hop bitterness, but skews toward sour as the brew warms. Drink this one on the quick side.

The mouthfeel is pretty darn good though. Very light, crisp, and with more carbonation than I thought.

Efes Pilsener,4.0,4.5,4.25,4.75,"Need to start my review with the conclusion: this is a very good beer. Didn't know what to expect and it fulfilled all that it could.
It is a Pilsener however closer to an American adjunct but rich, rich in hops and malts. 
Its smell reminds me a bit of Carlsberg, at least the hoppiness of a non-Czech pilsener. The taste is even more so, although light but still offers a round, full taste - a tiny bit of dry bitterness lingers on the palate in the end.
Very refreshing and easy to drink and the added CO2 is not strong either, very fine bubbly that just helps the beer to be backed down one after the other - because this is how this beer feels, something you drink for pleasure especially on hot summer days and nights, by the sea, with barbecue or grilled meat, ""the Mediterranean beer"" brings all of this.

Tastes of a sweet, toffee maltiness, coated up by wheat and a bubbly effervescence. Develops a short hop presence of dried herbs, together with a subtle, bitter peak. Finishes with a nice lingering dryness, balanced by toffee malts.

Leffe Blonde,4.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Leffe is crystal clear, pale amber in color slightly darker than the color of ripe hay. The head is dense, mousse-like, and lasting.
Taking a sniff, the first impression I get of Leffe's aroma is that it's mildly, delicately barnyard in nature. On closer examination though, I smell clove combined with toasted grain. Generic spiciness and Belgian funk combine with a juiciness that somehow reminds me of ripe orchard fruits. Notes of honey bind the aroma together into a lightly perfumed whole.
Leffe is smooth and medium bodied, with a light carbonation dancing across the tongue. Honey-like sweetness comes through first, leading directly into light but notable flavors of clove and malt tinted flavors of bread dough. Hints of what could be banana come through at this point before moving on to the next flavors. Belgian and alcoholic spiciness come through in the middle, adding crisp punctuation to the previous flavors. The finish is crisp, dry, and just a little bit bitter.
It's got a lot of interesting flavors going on without becoming so funky overall as to become unlikable. The flavors are spicy and malty, with just a hint of banana rounding things out in the center. Those same flavors keep themselves from crossing a line into becoming too spicy and funky for their own good.Apr 05, 2021"

My first Belgian blonde, can't imagine it's too different from a Belgian pale except with less aggressive hops. Looks like this one is the most reviewed of its style, same as their Brune

Pours a clear gold with 2 fingers of white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

The aroma is very estery, lots of white pepper, bubblegum, earthy honey, and sweet pears. A nice floral aroma that I can't quite put my finger on

The flavor starts off bright, lots of pear, some lemon, white pepper, and a touch of bubblegum. The swallow brings notes of sweet malt, floral grain, and white grape

A light medium body pairs with effervescent carbonation for a super refreshing beer. Finishes sweet and dry, reminiscent of a chardonnay

Leffe Blonde,5.0,2.5,4.0,5.0,"Leffe isn't overly carbonated; you are able to note the subtle flavours of the beer, enjoying it's sparkling yet mildly thick texture. 

The scent and flavours are very unique; the nose is quite floral, mostly ylang ylang but with a slightly orange undertone. The flavours are extremely odd. At first they made me gag (not ideal praise) but with more thought and tasting, they are fantastic. This manages to have an initial taste of vanilla bean, being very sweet and cloying. After a few sips however the flavour develops into something extremely savoury; it tastes like cooked tomatoes and fresh basil. I have never had a beer quite like it, and it certainly grows on you.

A straightforward pale lager that doesn't stray far from the standard Euro lager profile. Aroma and flavor are spot on. This looks quite attractive and has a better body than I expected with a little silkiness to the mouth feel. Not a style I seek out, but a more than satisfactory beer with my Peruvian meal.

Enjoyed form the 11.something oz bottle in a pint glass. This lager pours a medium yellow with a light head of foam that dissipates to a thin ring and little lacing. Nose of light grains, light bittering hops, and a touch of honey. Flavors follow the nose with sweet light honey like malts and light grain notes following a light floral hops characteristic that is pleasing.

T: A grape-like malt flavor is the dominant theme, backed up by grain and some very light hops. Finish is relatively clean with just a little bit of lingering bready malt.

M: True it its name, it has a (relatively) dry finish, enhanced by a very mild alcohol sensation. Low carbonation makes this quite quaffable.

Birra Moretti,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.25,"0ml brown bottle. Label has best by date of 'AUG2020'.
Clear, pale gold colored body. Skinny finger of white head upon pouring quickly recedes to a partial cap and ring. Leaves a few scattered spots of lacing.
Aroma is scant and yields some bready malts.
Taste shows lager malt and thin sliver of grassy hops. Has a little sweetness. Very short flavor profile.
Thin mouth feel. Crisp. Very good carbonation.
Best when cold, and somewhat refreshing, and a good one to pair with food. This beer will not interfere with the food flavors.Feb 02, 2020"

Birra Moretti,4.5,3.5,3.75,4.0,"(11.2 oz brown bottle - L'Autentica... poured into an Innis & Gunn fluted goblet)

L: very very pale brassy colored liquid; fantastic rocky, whipped creamy stand of lasting white foam - huh?! - big crusty bands of lace

S: immediately upon crown removal - skunked?! - maybe not... anyway, once that note fades, the lightly toasty pale malt pokes through, maybe even some cigarette tobacco, herbal/grassy hops, malt syrup... pretty familiar, recognizable pale mass-producer lager aromas

T: malty, but thinly so... subtle peppery spice and phenolic note in the finish... bitterness low but not dull; has sort of radicchio-like flavor/bitter quality... aftertaste dry and mildly straw/grainy, later some floral essence emerges... relatively nice flavors, wanting to be fuller, but perhaps just missing some dimension with the grains

F: despite it not coming across so much on palate, the malt does lend to a very delicately silky texture in the middle, residual film after, while the finish has a certain dryness, but is not bone about it... carbonation is abundant, but has only a miniature sizzle

O: malt liquor-ish, with a bright, spicy crispness... like other Euro pales, more to enjoy than American adj. counterparts... would grab this again, maybe on tap while out to eatAug 14, 2018"

Birra Moretti,3.75,4.0,3.75,3.5,"Sometimes you have to look at what's posted and say, ""Screw it, I liked this beer...""

Just comparing it to other lagers, I found it to be as solid as any others that others may find good. The pour provided a nice foam build-up with a touch of lacing, early on; the beer was clear and clean looking. What met my nose was a wheaty smell to go with the malty base, again, finding it quite enjoyable. I found this beer to be light-bodied without being watery like many other lagers out there. The taste had a citrus twang to it that added flavor without having to put the lime in the bottle. Overall, this was a surprise - maybe not the greatest thing out there, but definitely worthy of my ""camping beer"" category (and just in time to go camping!)Apr 01, 2018"
Birra Moretti,4.25,2.5,2.75,3.25,"Develops a nice honey-hay color with a surprising amount of head retention; starting out at 3 fingers and dolling down to 1/2 after a few minutes. 

Aromas of walking through a moldy forest, mixed with some hay and straw in the spare barn after it rained the day before. Quite a bit of vegetal action. Some clean adjunct. Metal.

On the front half, the taste is clean and crisp, with a firm Saaz-like bitterness, fading to pilsner malts...and on the back end and finish it mixes with moldy hay, cooked carrots, and hints of old honey. The more you drink it, the better it gets, but it gave some palate shock on the first sip. Almost spit it out. 

Feel is crisp, clean, but has a starchy, chalky finish. 

Overall, as much as I hate to admit it, it's hitting the spot. It's really something to drink if your only other choice is Bud Light. Not sure where that situation would crop up, but I definitely won't be having this on purpose again.Feb 03, 2018"

Taste: Slightly bitter, moderate grain bill, with minor hop character. Not a lot of flavor otherwise, at least it doesn't require any thought to drink or induce any guilt if you drink it fast. 
Feel: Highly carbonated, lively. Light-medium body that foams up a bit on the palate.

Beck's Dark,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.75,"Pours kind of a brownish color but without much viscosity to it. Small less brown in color head, 1/5"" and no retention. Aroma of brown malt roasted, I don't get any skunkiness like I do from the regular version of Beck's. 

Taste of metal and earth making me think of the Industrial Revolution. Slightly lighter in body than your average dunkel, somewhat brought in that direction by the higher than average carbonation. Bitterness is there, noble hop and roasted malt derived I would guess.

Beck's Dark,3.5,2.25,2.75,3.25,"I grabbed a bottle from my folks' house. The bottling code states it's still good for another couple months. Poured right from the fridge into an imperial pint glass.

L: Pours a cola brown--slightly ruddy at the edges--with about an inch of tan head that dissipates very quickly down to just a weak ring that leaves minimal lacing on the glass. Moderate visible carbonation.

S: A bit of a nondescript bouquet. There's some weak malts, stewed corn, some skunk, and a bit of earthiness in the mix. Not very pleasant.

T: Cracker and bread-like malts up front, along with a bit of cracked pepper. The middle brings on the characteristic flavor of corn, lending the brew some of its sweetness. There are some lemon notes that add tartness that carries into the back end. There's more of the somewhat indiscernible malts at the close, along with a touch of earthiness and skunk.

F: Lighter-bodied, this one drinks a little thin and watery. There's some creaminess to this, but toward the end it started to feel flat. It's a bit tart, but there's no discernible bitter.

O: I know that I've had this beer years ago, and I remember it being better than this. Those adjuncts really come across quite clearly--much more clearly, unfortunately, than any malt or hop flavors. I won't be returning to this one.Aug 18, 2015"

Beck's Dark,3.5,3.5,2.25,3.0,"$1.49 singles cooler edition.

Appearance (3.5) : Ha. That's funny. Here I thought it was a black label but the honey colored beer along with the green bottle makes it look black. Creative. Anyways there's a pretty tall and creamy head that stands about three fingers. The body is a dark honey/oktoberfest color with about 80% opacity.

Aroma (3.5) : Wheat, caramel toasted malts, some musty grain, and earthy hop. Smells a bit like a Vienna or an Amber. A bit sweet at the end, maybe brown sugar? Not a bad or offending smell, and somewhat complex.

Taste (2.25) : Not good. I can already tell this is probably going to be a drain pour. Some sour malts with what tastes like an old jawbreaker. Old coffee grounds. Malts are a bit toasted but burnt too. Sour and bitter notes that don't really amount to anything. They are just there, and they clash. It just has this burnt flavor. And lots of ugly sour hop. It's really not good at all.

Mouthfeel (3.25) : Mildly creamy, finishes dry. Medium bodied.

Overall (2.83) : If Beck's Premium Lager didn't scare me away from the brewer, this one did. This very well may be my last Beck's beer I ever try. These guys are horrible. Whether you look at it as a dark ale or look at it as a ""Dunkel"", it's a fail either way. I've had both styles, neither of which this beer represents. It's burnt, sour, earthy, and bitter. Just blech. What's even worse is that it's really the definition of mediocre.Oct 20, 2014"

Beck's Dark,3.0,3.0,2.75,2.75,"Sampled last night on 5/5/14 and had this one many times before but has been awhile. Used to be imported from Germany but now made by Anheuser Busch. Bottle chilled down to 36 degrees F in my beer cooler and poured into a handled glass stein.

Pours a very dark amber in color with a lighter tan head that dissipates quickly that leaves some lacing when sipped but not much. Smells and tastes different to what I remember back in the '80's and early '90's even. Aroma is of roasted malts with a hint of brown sugar. Taste is on the weak side and not like I really remember. Overall, disappointed.May 06, 2014"
Beck's Dark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Hi all,
Have been a long time Euro beer (mostly German) drinker since the late 60's, I know these days and even back then Beck's was never at the high end of the beer list, but it has always been good choice when nothing else was around or you were lucky enough to find a fresh barrel on tap.

Well a few weeks ago I was at one of the chain liquor stores that happen have Becks reg and dark on sale, so I picked up a few cases of the dark. Then I remembered something about Bud buying out Becks or bottling it for them here.

Now for the important part, I had a bottle of Becks dark and it was pure ""PANTHER PISS"" the old familiar prune-ish taste was gone. I really do not drink Bud but if I did I would imagine a can of that w/ some liquid smoke poured in. I bought a few cases of this so I figured it may or been a bad bottle or two but tried another and had a few friends over and had them try it. I really do not want to post what as said about the product.

So I guess another brewer went the way of the past selling out there heritage or perhaps just had to get out of the business as they could not keep up w/ all the new crud on the market.

To the board, sorry I'm not well versed enough on posting the characteristics , just called it as I saw it.

Shame on PUD !Jan 24, 2014"
Beck's Dark,3.25,2.5,2.75,2.0,"oz. bottle poured into a pint glass ~ had this review written for ages, just never transferred it to here.

A: Not quite opaque dark brown with a light tan head that quickly diminishes to nothing, but leaves respectable lacing. Some mahogany hues shine though with the sunlight.

S: Lots of bready malts, and not much else. A little bit of toasted malt maybe? Mostly clean here... Moving on.

T: Some weird tasting toasted malts... Not a whole lot of hop flavor; it just provides a weak touch of bitterness in the finish. It's not offensive, but there's really not much to talk about here.

M: Really light-bodied and thin with a bit of slickness that finishes a lot like a fountain soda. There's not much here to keep your palate wanting more.

O: I guess Beck's Dark isn't as offensive as it gets, but it's definitely not as good as it could be. There's definitely some good qualities to this brew, but not enough to outweigh the bad qualities. I wouldn't call it offensive, but it's definitely something to stay away from if there's other options.Dec 17, 2013"
Beck's Dark,3.0,2.5,1.5,2.0,"Beck's Dark used to be my favorite all-around go-to beer. It had the perfect balance of malt and hops, that clean crisp lager body, a depth of character and richness. As with most import beers, you sometimes got a batch that wasn't as fresh as it should have been, but it was a very good to excellent product. 

Since InBev domesticated it, it's turned into two-dimensional swill. Budweiser with a darker hue and different packaging. I gave the new stuff several chances in recent months, and for a period of time, I was able to compare it head to head with some of the older German-made stock some stores still had in inventory. It's been uniformly disappointing to the point I've given up entirely on it in search of a replacement. I guess they do this because the economics work - shave every production corner you can and drive up margins. It doesn't work for me. I don't drink a lot, so when I do, I want quality, and I'd rather pay a few bucks more if that's what it takes to keep a product authentic and good.Nov 05, 2013"

Beck's Dark,4.5,3.0,3.25,3.5,"A- Pours a medium, chocolate brown in color. Fairly clear in body, but sight through the beer is reduced greatly by its dark color. Larger, 3 finger head forms on top and retains very well. Lacing is good.

S- Light and very similar to regular Becks on the nose. Typical pilsner scent with a hint of skunky-ness. A little bit of bitterness in there, as well as a hint of darker malts.

T- Starts off light and grainy in flavor, before a slight hint of darker malt flavors peaks in for a brief minute. The beer ends with a slight hops bitterness that balances out the lighter flavor of the beer.

M- Rather smooth and drinkable, like most German styles. Lighter in body than most German lagers, but still giving the creamy feel. Low to medium amount of carbonation.

Chimay Blue is a god-tier beer. Red is one that is not quite as acclaimed, but if it matches the quality of Blue I will be very impressed. Also, despite my love for Belgian beers, I have not had very many Dubbels, though I thoroughly enjoyed the one’s I’ve had. Let’s see if this legend lives up to the hype

Pours a murky mahogany color with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that very slowly fades to a cap and leaves minimal lacing

The nose here is beautiful balanced with the dark fruit and subtle spice complementing the chewy malt. I’m picking up on aromas of gold raisin, fig, dark toffee, allspice, brown bread, clove, and a hint of caramel

This focuses on the malt way more heavily in flavor, but works in its advantage. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting raisin, sticky toffee, brown bread, light black cherry, and white pepper. The swallow brings notes of sweet black cherry, clove, doughy malt, light vanilla, molasses, and caramel

A medium full body pairs with very gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth and luxuriously creamy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a wonderful sweetness

Such a wonderfully crafted beer, absolutely perfect for a warm summer night. I’d get it far more frequently if it wasn’t $8 a bottleJul 28, 2021"

Aroma of bready malt, Belgian yeast and banana/cloves spices.
Taste is candy malt which is slightly sweet, along with the yeast esters that express banana and cloves. More minor, but definitely there, fruity hops punch. Sweet, bready, with a tang note from the yeast. More dry at the end.

Taste: Malty, caramel/brown sugar, banana, spice, clove, some dried dark fruits. Delicious. 
Feel: Mid bodied, mouth filling but not heavy. A prickly carbonation in the mid palate. A dry finish. 
Overall: Delicious. A was a little apprehensive on first smell, but it opened up quite well over the course of the beer.Feb 13, 2021"
Chimay Red,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"L: Copper brown. Hazy (unfiltered, unpasteurized, bottle conditioned). Lots of creamy head with stubborn lacing.

S: Banana bread (Clove from the yeast)

T: Wow. Tangy bready wheat with faint grassy hops. Quite nice. Good beer is simple but well made.

F: Smooth clean finish, melts in your mouth, full bodied, packs a kick.

O: One of the most impressive brews I've ever had.Jan 28, 2021"

Chimay Red,4.5,4.25,4.75,5.0,"Appearance: Murky copper color. Tall off white/almost light tan head that settles into a thin puck. Spotty lacing.
Smell: Spicy and phenolic. Old spice cabinet, oak, whole grains.
Taste: Complex and rustic. Peppercorns, dry and yeasty, whole wheat bread, light brown sugar, hint of date, maybe some allspice or clove. 
Feel: On the lighter side. Lots of carbonation but it isn't too aggressive. Bone dry finish. No alcohol warmth at all.
Overall: Spicier and drier than the blue but not as sweet. Confirmed good shit.Dec 18, 2020"
Chimay Red,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.0,"Review from past tasting, served a cellar temperature into a Chimay Challis - poured to empty the bottle with a nice tight creamy head...dark brown, not too murky not too clear...on the nose, classic Chimay yeast esters - fruits (stone), leather and a bit of Candi sugar along with the expected strong malt backbone---on the mouth, up front as the nose, opening up in the middle and back with hop bitterness to clear the palette with a gentle warming all the way down. A solid everyday selection.Oct 18, 2020"
Chimay Red,4.5,4.0,4.25,4.25,"A - Restrained pour into a Chimay Chalice producing a brownish-red/ ruby copper brew with a parchment colored 1"" inch head. This brew is highly carbonated with good lacing. This is an translucent, cloudy brew. Elegant appearance.

S - Sweet toffee, caramel, and fruit. There's an undoubtable hefeweizen quality present; banana is in attendance. There is also an obvious clove or nutmeg characteristic. 

T - Robust, complex. Sweet but no overly so. Banana, clove, apricot, mineral, metallic (in the best way possible). Chimay offerings are hard to pin down. Either way, amazingly great tasting. There are no artificial flavors whatsoever. 

M - Clean and fresh. For the ABV, thinner than what I would expect. 

D - Fantastic drinkability. Not a session beer due to the cost/ abv but, I must admit, I'd love to try. This is an amazing brew. It is a must try. You won't regret it.Oct 11, 2020"

Chimay Red,4.0,4.25,4.5,4.5,"I started out not liking Begian beer, for being too foul and yeasty, and for some reason I was convinced that every beer from tjem is like that. I don’t even recall what made me feel like that. Was it a wit? No idea.
At one point a friend of mine gave me a Westmalle and it was surprisingly good. It gave me back faith in Belgian beer - and since I started trying out a few ones recently, I must admit that all of them have been excellent, just like this Chimay. This one smelled a bit sweet with a kind of fizz, I was expecting some Brett in there but I guess there wasn’t? Although I wouldn’t be surprised if there was because the beer was quite intensely carbonated, very finely carbonated just like a Brett and had a slightly champagne-esque character, although it wasn’t dry. On the contrary, it had a very decent malt presence that made the beer a bit sweet with caramel overtones? Still, overall the beer wasn’t just like a sweet brown ale, it is much more interesting than that. The booze? Maybe. The yeast? Must be. The hops? Well, it must have been an interplay between all of these. It is a very well made beer. Let’s see what the other colors (white and blue) have to offer next time!Jul 11, 2020"
Chimay Red,4.0,2.0,1.25,3.0,"Poured into Belgian glass, an attractive burgundy with deep plum color. Very thin head that dissipated quickly. Smelled heavily of tobacco, vinegar and leather with a fig and date undertone, slight spice. Tasted like I was drinking tobacco leaf juice...not very sweet or tart and not what I expected from my favorite style of beer. Judging by other reviews my beer may have been bad. Nothing like the reviews Ive read. Glad I tried it though.May 19, 2020"
Chimay Red,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Pours a figgy brown colour. The smell is the classic Belgian aroma. The taste combines the aforementioned Belgian spicyness with dried fruit (figs, raisins, dates) Less bitter than other Belgian wannabes. Overall one of the best Belgian beers I’ve tried.

Chimay Red,4.0,4.25,4.0,4.0,"0 ml bottle with Easter dinner.
Pours a dark caramel amber with finger + of khaki head.
Aroma of toffee, caramel malt, bready, Belgian yeast, and some fruity esters - dark fruit, hint of cherry. As warmed more complex spicy note.
Taste is up front sweet caramel malt, bready, gingerbread, slightly nutty, with again notes of fruity esters and a touch of bitterness at the back end.
Medium full mouthfeel with average carbonation - slightly tart but sweet caramel and fruitiness coating palate. Very good.Apr 11, 2020"
Chimay Red,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,"A very nice Dubbel and one that I enjoy a lot. It is an ""easier"" drink that the White and Blue Chimay's though not as full-bodied or as good a taste.Apr 10, 2020"
Chimay Red,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,"Look: Copper red with 1 1/2 fingers of white head which gives way after a few minutes, leaving a small light head across the top.
Smell: Apricots, malts, earthy and a hard to describe soapy sourness.
Taste: Cinnamon and pears. Spice and yeasty with a hint of pumpernickel bread. 
Feel: Very interesting, starts out a little watery and subtle at the start. After a few seconds in the mouth the beer really opens up with a spicy and creamy expression. Fills the whole mouth with something going on all over the tongue and palate. 
Overall this beer earns a solid A.Mar 23, 2020"
Chimay Red,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"33cl bottle into a tulip.

L: Clear, brilliant deep chestnut body under an inch of dense, creamy white foam. Solid retention and lacing. Quite attractive, if not quite as voluminous in the head department as many Belgians can be.

S: Vibrant, complex aroma with elements of bread crust, dried fruit, and spice all playing significant roles. A bit of banana and cinnamon interplay as well. Really nice.

T: Malty, nutty, and moderately sweet up front, with some spice (more clove than cinnamon) arriving just before the dry, mildly bitter finish. Balanced and enjoyable, but not as layered as the aroma.

F: On the light side of medium-bodied, with ample fine effervescence. 

O: Excellent beer, up there with my favorite Dubbels. Maybe the best Chimay offering relative to its style.

Beers of Fame tick 193/250. Cheers!Feb 14, 2020"
Chimay Red,4.5,4.0,4.25,4.5,"Poured from a 330 mL bottle into a goblet.

Look - Opaque mahogany head with explosive and very active poofy eggshell colored head that lingers for almost forever and leaves behind some mighty impressive lacing.

Smell - An immediate impression of roasted carrots, but that soon gets out of the way for brown sugar, caramel, and molasses. Some rye bread and spicy citrus on the backend.

Taste - Caramel brownies, gingerbread cookies, and maple syrup. Very sweet with no distinguishable bitter character, yet somehow not at all unbalanced.

Feel - Thick, creamy, and velvety smooth with a gentle fizzy finish.

Overall - Powerful yet reserved. Like a liquid dessert. Full-bodied and rich, and quite delicious.Jan 01, 2020"
Tuborg,2.5,2.25,2.75,2.75,"Had it at a restaurant looked funky didn’t recognize the name.

Pours a straw yellow colour with small head that leaves no lacing. 
Smells of lightly bready malt and literally nothing else.
Tastes of malt and not a whole lot else. Tastes like the copy paste lager.
Mouthfeel is light with medium-high carbonation.

Overall, this doesn’t have that Pilsner pop that you’d hope for but it’s also a lot better than the American industrial lagers so I’m not going to bash it at all. Not sure what I expected when I got it since the beer selection was very industrial/uninspired. Should have went with wine I suppose.Mar 27, 2021"

Not much of a nose. Mostly clean, faint malt and a wisp of lemon towards the end.
Moderate malt sweetness, bready and well balanced by a light touch of hops bitterness. A nice touch of lemon and grassy hops spice in the finish.
Light, crisp and smooth at the same time. Good moderately gentle carbonation, not too fizzy.

Tuborg,3.0,1.0,4.5,4.0,"Review: 33cl green bottle of Tuborg Pilsener (German version): ABV: ; 4.9% vol

The Germany-brewed Tuborg “Premium Quality” Pilsener. Coming in a nice looking green bottle with a rather distinctive logo. The crown representing the fact that the beer was “official court supplier of the Danish court” since 1914, as they state on their website. 

For the appearance, initially looks pretty good, all sparkling with a nice head of foam and a lovely golden colour, but boy does it go all flat very quickly with the head not lasting too long. 

Has a faint lagery smell, a bit malty and sweet, nothing amazing on the nose.

On taste, I got nice big mouthfuls at the start that were a bit hoppy and I could really feel the grains, not a bad initial taste.

The beer has a nice kick to it. Fruity, sweet, bitter, grainy, malty.

Taste a bit of corn as well. Not a bad tasting beer, slightly a bit too overboard with the hops perhaps, as it is a lager after all?

Not a bad tasting beer. Yeah not bad. Lagery taste with a slight kick. Bit of an aftertaste as well.
I feel the beer stops short of developing into something special, and for this reason I would like to try it again to give a better opinion. I have had it on draught and have come to the same opinion. I really am not sure if I like this beer or not, it always stumps me!Mar 17, 2018"

Smells of caramel, straw and dried leafes - subdued on the nose.

Has a light, softer mouthfeel with a metallic carbonation. Well balanced, but borderline thin.

Tastes of straw, aqua and a prominent mineralic spitziness, coated up by toffee malts. Finishes still very light and with just the faintest hop presence for a short glance.

Boring. This is well made as for its balance, apart from that there is just nothing standing out, exept its high, metallic carbonation.Aug 07, 2017"

T- Grainy, grassy, with a mild malt sweetness. 

M- Light body. Finish is very clean with no off-putting tastes or feels. About the best part of the beer.

T: The taste follows the smell and has flavors of malts with some hints of corn and sweetness. The hops contribute a light amount of bitterness.

Tuborg,2.75,3.0,2.75,2.75,"This particular can brewed in Turkey (!!!) ""under supervision of Carlsberg"". So brewed in Turkey and then shipped to Canada. What fun.

Good lord this is mediocre. Very, very pale gold/yellow. Light head that recedes quickly. Smell of cereal and light bitter greens. Slight raw dough scent which is present in the taste as well. Also a watery kind of pepper (?), cereal, bland light hops. Surprisingly heavy body for such a low ABV style. Light-ish carbonation.

Not good. It doesn't, like, offend my sensibilities, but it's not good. Drinkable, but did I mention that it's not good?Mar 08, 2016"
Tuborg,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.25,"This rating is for the German version brewed in Hamburg under license. To start a plastic bottle with screw off lid...released in time for the European Football championships. Nice malty aroma, and decent appearance poured into a pilsener glass (roughly).

Tuborg,2.75,2.5,2.5,3.25,"Format: a 330mL brown bottle with a pretty boring Euro macro label.

Appearance: pours a pale golden amber with chunky carbonation visible. A lumpy two-fingers of frothing white head drops to a thin cap.

Aroma: some heavy cereal grains with some awkward hops in the background. Ho-hum.

Taste: lots of adjuncts here - definitely corn and maybe rice. Some grain poking through. Seems a bit cheap.

Aftertaste: still awkward and cheap on the finish.

Mouth feel: light in body without being watery with a higher carbonation. Made specifically for hot weather, it would seem.

Overall: a pretty average macro lager. If I'm looking for a cheap lager, I would rather get a case of Oettinger for $31 a case (which is also a better beer) rather than a case of this for AU$45.Dec 17, 2014"
Tuborg,3.0,2.75,2.75,2.5,"Re reviewing this as it's probably been a full year since I've last tried it. 500 ml can purchased from LCBO for $2.00 CDN. Served cold into a pint glass.

Appearance - Weak pale golden straw color is poured. Nearly 2 fingers of head is poured but retention time isn't great and no lacing left as the head makes it's rapid descent. Very few bubbles actually and the beer is clear.

Smell - Slightly sweet, grainy aromatics, and the nose is fairly insubstantial. Not terribly impressed by this. At least it's not skunked like you would expect in the green bottles that are available.

Taste - Bland watery beer. Some sweetness but also kind of a very muted vegetative, earthy character. It's not bad it's just muted and generally lacking in flavor.

Mouthfeel - Nice clean finish, but the carbonation is fairly low, even for something in the style. Wish it a a bit more crispness.

Overall - Tuborg Green is not a terribly bad Euro pale Lager, it's just more muted and less offensive than many, but also lacks the boldness and tastiness that some of them due have. Basically, akin to the flavor, this is a muted representative of the style, that's fine after a hard day's work or some yard work, but definite;y won't blow anyone's socks off.Jun 29, 2014"

Poured from 0.5L can into tulip. ABV says 4.5%; but all writig is norwegian. Pours a golden color with a finger of head - actualy nice lacing and rim of head remains. Smell is skunky fruity ""heineken""like. Taste is a bit fruitier than most of the style, but its not bad at all. Nice euro lager flavor, sweet, slight hops, but honestly its pretty good.

Tuborg,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,"The front label of this bottle of Tuborg Green proudly displays the words ""Copenhagen, Denmark."" But close examination of the back label reveals that this brew was produced in Rajasthan, India.

The beer pours a pale straw body with a thin fizzy head.

The nose is of untoasted grains and rust.

The taste follows the nose. Rusty metal and grains up front with a bit of metallic twang on the back end. The mouthfeel is thin and watery, just like the beer.

As a general rule, it's a good idea to stay away from all the Tuborg products available in India. The sweet malt liquors and lagers available here, in their hop-less sweetness, have a kind of charm. This one fails even to deliver on that level. If you must drink something and this is your only option, you still might pause and ask yourself just how thirsty you are before trying it.Dec 01, 2012"

Aroma of light malt with hints of stewed leaves, corn, overcooked veg and a faint but harsh sulphurous note in the background. Not nice.

Tastes of light malt accompanied by an unpleasant stewed leaf flavour. Hints of overdone veg, corn and a harsh background quality. Mild, dry bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is light, thin and watery, with tingly carbonation. Slightly astringent, with an aftertaste of stewed leaves.

Piss - not a good lager. The initial aroma/flavour seemed vaguely acceptable, with a hint of noble hops. However, everything went downhill fast once it began to warm up. Bland and boring with disgusting off-notes. Best avoided unless ice cold.Sep 07, 2012"

Tuborg,2.5,2.0,3.0,2.5,"Head disappears really quickly, so does the carbonation. Colour is pale bright gold, not particularly intriguing. 
Nose on this is rather assaulting, sort of a sour citrus. Taste is quite bland, though not terrible, flavours aren't composed together well, some citrus altogether quite light in taste, and a bit rough around the edges. Tt tastes a bit watered down, and this affects on the mouthfeel.
Finish is not profound, a kind of apple sourness pervades and it's not terribly memorable. Not one to seek out, fits into the style of mass-produced 'golden' lager without doing much to draw any good attention to itself.Jun 20, 2012"

Virtually no aroma unfortunately. Just the faintest notion of yeast.

There's not much complexity to it, but the taste is excellent. Dry, cracker like barley malt with a backdrop of sweet fruity banana like yeast; balanced out against floral, spicy noble hops.

Feel is crisp and light. Well carbonated. Refreshing at 4.80% ABV.

I definitely enjoyed this; the nose is the only thing it loses points on. I'm sure this beer is mind blowing if you're drinking it straight from the tap at the actually brewery in Germany, but by the time it gets bottled and shipped to America it loses some of it's character, at least I think so.Jul 15, 2021"

Smell - Smells like a standard lagered ale. Pickinging up scents of corn and corn syrup with bread on the end. Not going to lie, I got little beer up my nose trying too hard to discern scents. 

Taste - Very much follows the nose, but is also nicely crisp, which shuts down the sweetness from being over powering.

Smell to me is initially was lemony sweet but as it warmed a white grape, or apple?, really was noticeable. Incredibly pleasant smelling beer. Also some hay like notes in it as well. 

The taste mostly follows the nose on this one. Touch of honey in this one it also reminds me of this water crackers. 

Mouthfeel is light and very enjoyable. It is a very soft with a nice light soft carbonation. A nice subtle bitterness. Very clean and noticeably dry finish.

Gaffel Kolsch,4.25,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Poured from a freshness dated 16.9 oz. can: picture-perfect, bright and shiny gold with a sustained, foamy white head.

Perhaps the linkest link with this ale - somewhat muted noble hop aromas, but this style is not known for prominent aromas.

This one is quite refreshing and, according to the can, very fresh with a 12/22/2021 date stamped on the bottom. I can already see that this quite like a well-made Helles or pilsner with a well-rounded mouthfeel and flavor from the top-fermenting yeast. Very nice hints of lemon and vanilla dominate the flavor profile, while the hops keep the body crisp and dry. This ale is visually attractive and flavorful, but not hugely distinctive.

Gaffel Kolsch,5.0,2.5,5.0,5.0,"Clear gold. Smells of moss, vines, wet stone, raw dough. Tastes follows the smell completely with a touch of non descript fruity yeast vibes. Dry yet wet finish. Outstanding.Jan 12, 2021"
Gaffel Kolsch,5.0,4.5,4.5,5.0,"Appearance: Crystal clear, brilliant gold. Fluffy white head with great retention. Slow rising bubbles.

Aroma: Floral & grainy. Faint fruity esters apparent on initial pour.

Flavor & Aftertaste: Grainy, sweet, & mildly bitter.

Overall: This sample was several months old, but still tasty. Brilliant clarity and excellent head retention. Light to medium on the palate. Very crisp and refreshing. Good balance between sweet and malt. Grainy & floral aroma apparent. Grainy flavor prominent. Short crisp finish with a short lived mild bitterness.Nov 25, 2020"
Gaffel Kolsch,4.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Best before 6/7/2021; consumed on 11/20/20

Pours a crystal-clear, pure honey gold body topped with a massive, fluffy, eggshell-white head of foam; excellent retention leaves a finger of rocky cap and a brooding, soapy collar climbing up the glass, along with a dense coating of lacing.

Aroma opens with dry, grainy notes of popcorn kernels before a honeyed malt sinks in alongside husky corn; herbal tones build over time, highlighting both grass and straw as they dominate the close.

Taste shows notes of straw and, light minerality, and even lighter cereal grain to supplement upfront, progressing to a quick touch of honey over the mid-palate against crackery malts and building hop characteristics into the back end, including a pronounced grassiness, distant citrus rinds, and sparse hints of moss delivering an edge to the finish.

Mouthfeel offers a densely crisp light body alongside a fluffy, moderate-high carbonation dispersing evenly over the mid-palate with a pillowy grit amplifying steadily; a moderate bitterness brings heft to a heavily drying finish.

Grainy malt presents thoroughly from start to finish, though never quite outpaces the surprisingly hop-forward grassiness integrated across the profile, leaving a level yet plain Kölsch formed with good construction but otherwise doing little to distinguish itself in the style.Nov 21, 2020"

Gaffel Kolsch,4.25,3.75,4.0,4.0,"BA all over the map on this most popular beer in Koln. I find this as any Kolsch I have tried. Difficult to tease out all that's going on out of the bottle. 
a) First it pours a darker golden clear body that spouts a fervent stiffer, stickier, rocky head (better than most pilsners) that lasts and laces. 
s) Plenty of skunky, funky subtle aromas from the German Ale yeast, without being overwhelming, grain, lime. 
t) Plenty of flavor facets here: that yeast tempers down into green apple tea, lime, pilsner, lemon, and finishes with a signature, back-flavor that's woody and dank. 
f) Mid, smooth, appetizing. Great first beer of evening - now available at WFM. Must like a bit off, cellar flavors.

Hitachino Nest White Ale,4.75,3.5,5.0,2.75,"Overall a really great beer. Looks like a fairly classic wheat beer with that light unfiltered hue. Not much smell.

Hitachino Nest White Ale,3.5,3.0,3.25,3.5,"Wasn't entirely sure what to expect from this beer. Contra most of the reviews here, I actually found it in a can. A local beer monger had it in their cooler in an interesting folded-cardboard 4pack. To be totally honest, the packaging is what got me to pull the trigger as I'm not normally a fan of wheat beers.

Look - I mean I guess the packaging has to be part of that right? But the beer itself was a light orange, a bit hazy. 
Smell - Pretty much what I would have expected out of a white ale. Some spice, a bit of citrus if you're really looking for it.
Taste - So, like I said, I'm not actually a huge fan of wheat beers, so I'll try to be fair. The can I got said it was brewed with ""coriander nutmeg, orange peel and fresh orange juice"" and you can definitely get the citrus tang if you're looking for it. The spice profile is a bit much for me, you get the coriander and nutmeg at the start and then the citrus comes in. Small notes of bitterness towards the very end. 
Feel - Some fizz, no real aftertaste as such. 
Overall - I could see this being a really refreshing (to me) take on a wheat beer if they dialed up the orange like 20% and dialed the spice down like 10%. Something nice to sip on during a hot day, almost like a west coast IPA. At the same time, the 4 pack I got was like $20, so for that price point, probably not worth it to buy again.Apr 19, 2021"

pours a hazy red-tinged straw body with an excited chalk-white foamed head that has low retention and leaves no lacing as it settles to a halo

aroma is an earthy shade of orange tinged-hop, spice (coriander & nutmeg, as advertised), and sweet wheat

taste follows that nose pretty straight forward. very orange centric, very earthy, with spiced notes intermittent that funk it up a bit. the nutmeg is an interesting nod. 

moderately high carbonation and a medium-light body; it's juicy, smooth, soft, slightly pillowy. finishes with a low-key earthy bitterness.

overall:
very well balanced wheat beer that gets funky with the orange juice. as stated, the spice spread was an interesting choice and helps it stand out more; the nutmeg puts an kind of rustic spin on the style that was unexpected. this is one of those instances where you can just taste a higher quality in what you're drinking.Jan 24, 2021"

Nice white crown, very fine lacing.
Ambient aroma of citrus and malt.
Very fresh taste. Lemony citrus, but never outspoken. It's cloaked in with honey sweetness. Carbonation is noticeble.

T: The spices and orange peel come first, followed by a pale malt. My bottle is maybe 5 months old, and it's mellowed down alot from a fresh version. It's still a great drinking experience. 

F: Has a prickly, fizzy, fresh and refreshing orange flavor on the front palate. The pepper and spice go down with the malt to please your back palate.

O: Plenty of sophistication. It's excellent. The high price tag is a thing, but you gotta figure it's coming off of a boat from Japan and being shipped to central Ohio... There's like 2 Japanese restaurants in my county that carry this, tops, and me of course.Oct 15, 2019"

Hitachino Nest White Ale,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0," oz bottle, served at Sushi By Boū in New York, NY.

Poured from the bottle into a glass by the waiter, it had a light amber color with a creamy white head. Very cloudy in appearance. Complex mixed fruit and spice aroma. Orange, lemon, and coriander stand out in both the aroma and flavor. Wheat malt comes out upon tasting. Very fruity, slightly tart and refreshing. I didn't pick up any of the nutmeg that's listed in the ingredients. Medium-light bodied. I sipped this slowly to make sure it would last the duration of my meal, but could have drunk it much faster. The price tag is on the hefty side for what it is but I had to try this classic beer at least once! In all honesty, you could go with Allagash White at a fraction of the price.

An excellent accompaniment to an omakase sushi lunch, as it was versatile enough to pair with the various types of fish.Jan 01, 2019"

Pours up clear and looking like Duff. Great head - this looks like movie beer. The bottom of the bottle is cloudy with sediment, I should have done a swirl. Smells like a hefe more than an IPA: spice and banana and apple. Obnoxiously sweet and complex sniffs to be had. Big alcohol taste up front and then you're hit with the bitter back end complete with pears and apples and corn (?). Sadly tastes like Colt 45 came out with an IPA

Every so often I have a Belgian IPA and I'm quickly reminded why I'm not a huge fan of the flavor. It compromises both styles and ends up tasting like four beers mixed together: a great IPA, a great Belgian strong, and two bad homebrew imitationsSep 03, 2021"

t: follows the nose. coriander, pears, and green apple upfront. a hint of that banana and wheat behind that. pepper spice, red bell peppers and lemongrass follow. sweet grains and grass followed by a faint earthy herbal bitterness. some sweet citrus zest and a kiss of sweet malts. the funk is a bit subsided compared to the nose, but i'm picking up some of that barynard funk at the backend of this. the finish is slightly dry, crackery

Taste: again the blending of the two, the triple characteristics mild out the IPA hops, while the hope provide a really interesting kick to a triple like flavor. Although there is no banana flavor

A; pours a slightly hazed gold, with ample streams of thin bubbles and a thick, foamy, frothy, lasting, two-finger white head. Outstanding lacing.

S: smells like a tripel. Belgian yeast and wheat on the nose. Some fragrant soapy/floral qualities, hint of yeasty sourness.

T: arrives somewhat dry, phenolic, and somewhat bitter. Turns sweeter as it develops, then to mild medicinal hops, a bit of alcohol, then closing out with a lingering bold hip bitterness- but these are European hops so they do not overpower the senses.

M; midweight but with ample carbonation that makes it feel much lighter. 

O: I didn’t come into this beer with any expectations, and I am not disappointed. It is a highly alcoholic, highly hopped Belgian pale ale. It’s not a style I love because it has a lot of strong, complex flavors that go in different directions. It also has a ton of alcohol. It is to style, but an inharmonious one, if you ask me.

The nose is a really interesting aroma. I get the smell of the Belgian yeast, but then I also get a beautiful hop aroma mixed in. 
Taste - For sure a Belgian beer. The yeast creates more of a nice wild flavor up front. On the back the hops do kick in. They're not crazy strong, and I think the yeast mellows them out, but they are there. 
This doesn't drink like a 9% beer. Very smooth, and mellow feeling. Very good, and full body.

a hazy light orange gold body pours with an excited frothy foam off-white head that has very high retention and leaves splotches of sticky thin lacing as it settles

aroma is soft citrus, spicy Belgian yeast, and fresh grass hop. it's herbal, soft, and funky. whoa.

taste reveals something much more complex than what was advertised by the aroma..which is saying something. soft and floral lemon and grapefruit hops appear. the spices bloom with flashes of coriander, white pepper, backed by wheat and rock candy. soft bready malt that presents a little chewiness that lasts a moment. and this brew is fruity, man. but it is all so balanced that it never feels like the fruit is the focus. there are lemon peel and lush orange, lime spritz, grapefruit and white grape juice - and a soft, yet lush, dose of lemon. the grass hops mellow as you sit, growing more herbal and earthy. 

the mouthfeel is higher carbonation, medium body, with a nice dry and bitter finish. the abv is hidden but there are still a few booze infused carbo prickles to be had on occasion. 

overall:
I had a lemon meringue pie once in a cafe down in NOLA. the barista recommended it with an espresso and a side of lemon, and their house salad. I'm not exactly a salad guy, but when someone down in NOLA gives you a food-related tip, you take it, dammit. as I can firmly say about nearly every culinary adventure I've had in the big NO, I wasn't disappointed. somewhere between the soft sweet and chewiness of the lemon, the fresh herbal zeal, and the deep earthy bitterness, I found momentary nirvana. this brew hits a very similar target for me, for very similar reasons. the funk and complexity of Belgian yeast and merry brewmastery combined with an expert level IPA is something to behold in the exact formula of this brew. it covers so many bases, so many reference points to pick up and enjoy or sit down and study. brilliant. just brilliant.Jan 23, 2021"
La Chouffe,4.0,4.0,3.75,3.75,"Very interesting, and quite different from what I was expecting. Shared a 750 ml bottle with a friend. Nice notes of bread and grape and yeasty goodness with a hint of spice with a creeping funkiness underneath that didn't quite sit right with me. Well crafted for the style but not anything I need to have again.Jan 16, 2021"
La Chouffe,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,"Pours a hazy golden color with an enormous stiff white runaway long lived head.

Tastes of bread, spice with a subtle hoppy finish. The alcohol hides well. 

Medium light body with light carbonation. Light crisp mouthfeel. 

One excellent brew!Jan 06, 2021"
La Chouffe,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,"Cloudy golden appearance with a huge, billowing, long lasting head and beautiful lacing. Aroma is herbal hops, spices, mild citrus, honey and yeast. Multifaceted taste revels in its complexity, from floral, hoppy bitterness, to sweet, bready malts through to an appealing funkiness. Medium-to-full bodied mouthfeel with a decent level of carbonation. Funkiness lingered in the finish. Very interesting and thoroughly enjoyable.Dec 31, 2020"
La Chouffe,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,"From the stubbi bottle of the variety pack in the tulip glass that came with it.
Beautiful white fluffy head that lasts forever.
Hazy golden color and lots of visible carbonation rising up.
This is a pleasant IPA, you have the bitter but it is balanced with the yeast.
The lacing looks incredible as you take sip after sip.
I really enjoyed this one!Sep 05, 2020"
La Chouffe,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"330 ml bottle into a tulip snifter. BB July 2019, had 5/17/18. One of three reviews I missed putting in earlier.

Pours a really bright golden color, mostly clear, with a two inch head of creamy foam with good retention and lots of thick foamy lacing. Active carbonation. Looks great. Aromas of Belgian yeast, citrus- lemon, some orange, some pine, white grapes, coriander, cloves, black pepper, other spices, light malt, some wheat. Has an herbal aroma, with a hint of sweetness. The flavors are more or less the same- Belgian yeast, lemon, white grapes, wheat, malt, some pine, coriander, cloves, other spices, some sweetness- candi sugar? An herbal and earthy hop presence, with a fair amount of hop bitterness that builds to the finish and lingers on. Smooth, crisp, dry, a very good medium body, well carbonated 

A terrific example of a Belgian IPA. Complex, with layers of aromas and flavors. So well done. Well worth a purchase at a great price point.Aug 28, 2020"
La Chouffe,3.75,4.0,4.25,4.0,"Purchased as part of there discovery pack and poured into the same glass contained within to reveal a fairly clear golden body with decent enough white head

La Chouffe,3.75,4.0,4.0,3.75,"Good IPA from Achouffe. Medium bodied, crisp and fresh, complex taste. Little too bitter for my likings. Try the Chouffe soleil, much beter, more balanced.Aug 13, 2020"
La Chouffe,4.0,4.0,4.25,4.0,"Medium bodied with about the same for th carbonation.

Taste is very similar to aroma but with a bitter citrus peel flavor showing up first and dominating. Earthy, floral and pine follow in the aftertaste. 
Overall it's an excellent beer that was interesting and flavorfulAug 07, 2020"
La Chouffe,4.0,4.0,4.25,4.25,"From the stubby bottle in a snifter. This solid little Belgian IPA
pours a chill hazed yellow straw color with a nice head of white 
foam that settles to a thick ring, thin clumping layer, and displays 
nice light lacing. Nose of light mango, light pineapple, grassy hops,
Belgian candy sugars, and light yeast notes. Flavors surpass the nose 
with candy sugars awash in herbal, grassy, and citrus laden hops 
that have basked in the glow of cracker and subtle Belgian yeast 
goodness. Nice mouth feel; medium light body, medium carbonation,
subtly effervescent and lively, and finishing with a sweet Belgian
sugar and balanced hop note.

Overall----a SOLID Belgian IPA with American hop flair.

Nice!Jul 25, 2020"
La Chouffe,4.0,4.25,4.5,4.5,"330mL bottle BBE 11/2020 poured into a tulip glass at fridge temp 9% ABV. The beer pours slightly hazy in a light honey color with nearly white head. The head recedes slowly to thick cap leaving plenty of lacing. The aroma is moderate in strength featuring grassy hops, stone fruit and clovey yeast. The taste is semisweet with clove, pale bready malt, subtle stone fruit and grassy & floral hops on the medium plus bitter finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with slightly above average carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, excellent. This is about as good of a Belgian IPA as you will experience. I was concerned about the best before date being 3 months away, but very fresh tasting.Jul 23, 2020"
La Chouffe,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours cloudy hazy orange amber with a dense creamy white foam head. Smells real citrusy with lemon, orange peel, grapefruit, some toasty caramelized malt, hint of banana, apricot, yeasty funk, spice, and earthy floral resinous piney hops. Tastes dry and refreshing with lemony citrus, orange peel, grapefruit, peppery spice, green banana, apricot, toasty bready caramelized malts, some yeasty funk, and earthy floral resinous woody piney hops. Feels medium bodied, creamy and airy with smooth moderate carbonation. Overall a nice Belgian IPA Tripel.Jul 20, 2020"
Negra Modelo,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Seemed quite fizzy when pour but actually not that carbonated. Dark brown color, thin foam, didn't last long. On sweet side, feels of caramel like it's color. Not much else going on. Thin body. Not really bitter. It's just ok.Sep 12, 2021"
Negra Modelo,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,"2oz bottle into a pint glass. Best by February 2022.

Looks okay. Clear deep reddish amber body. The initial foamy tan head doesnt last long, becoming a thin ring and covering. No lacing.

Faint sweet lightly roasty malty aroma.

On tasting, it's on the sweet side. Does have that dunkel flavor, but very weak in the body.

Mouth between thin and medium, finish slightly dry and faintly roasty.

Overall, kind of a dunkel-lite feel. No bad, just not much substance.Sep 02, 2021"

Negra Modelo,3.25,3.0,3.0,2.75,"Pours a light copper color with a small head. 

Very mild aromas of brown bread, cereal grains, and roasted nuts.

Flavor is basically brown bread with some grape nuts. Maybe Raisin Bran. No hop presence. Not terrible. Inoffensive and drinkable.

Feel is very watery with minimal carbonation. Bad batch? Definitely not right for the style. Beer is fresh, as dated on the bottle.

Overall, this is a...drinkable beer, I guess. Not something I'd stick my nose up at if it was offered to me. Both bottles I had were like flat soda, so not sure what happened there. Otherwise, the flavors and aromas are inoffensive at worst.Jul 16, 2021"
Negra Modelo,3.75,3.5,3.75,5.0,"Six pack from Food Express in Tobyahanna, freshness dated until 2-2022. I had one of these recently after not tasting one for about a decade, and I must say I'm very impressed... and not just by the gold foil! I figured I'd give it a proper review. 12 oz. bottle poured into standard pilsner glass.

Look: Dark like a schwarzbier (my autocorrect keeps going to Schwarzenegger, which makes sense since this beer is a frickin' Action Hero). A solid cap of beige foam leaves behind very leggy lacing, clinging all over the place.

Smell: Fresh rye bread and a little hint of something like coffee or dark chocolate, but not very strong. Also a surspisingly pleasant vegetal note mixed in there somewhere.

Taste: Sweet but not too sweet. A little bit of hop bitterness up front, then rich chocolate malt coats the mid palate and finishes clean, with a little bit of hoppy skunk remaining akin to a Heineken. This aspect reminds me the most of regular Modelo (or ""Modelo Especial"" if you're nasty).

Feel: So, so, SO smooth. If you're looking for a Mexican session beer that doesn't require a lime, THIS is your boy right here. This stuff just glides down your throat, it's like drinking a majestic swan.

Overall, this is one of the best beers you can find almost anywhere, and by that I mean you can go to almost any store that sells beer and they'll carry this. There are better beers out there, but I'd gamble that none are as widely available or reasonably priced. In a word... Excellent.Jul 11, 2021"
Negra Modelo,3.0,2.25,3.0,2.0,"Tastes pretty decent for what it is, it's a malty Modelo that remains light and refreshing, but it has an astringency after every sip that I can't get past.May 31, 2021"
Negra Modelo,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.75,"Twenty-four lovely ounces of fluid poured from two squat brown twelve ounce bottles now temporarily reside in clear glass liter mug. The color is a solid dull brown, a little lighter on the fringes, with a modest biege head. A pleasant aroma of malt, hops and yeast allow the nose to share pleasure with the eyes. For a brown beer with an appealing aroma, the taste is on the mild side. Yeast and barley malt dominate the flavor, but there's enough hoppiness to keep it far from being too sweet. So much richer in taste and mouthfeel than ordinary lagers, but it's not up to the level of a good ale. Probably the best offering from this brewery, it can pair nicely with spicy foods. The glass lacing is even more modest than the head. This is a good example of the German-Austrian influence on Mexican brewing.May 27, 2021"
Negra Modelo,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,"I've always liked this one cold with a lime. Not much to look at, not much to smell, not a lot of taste, but refreshing. For a mass-produced Mexican beer, this is the best available.May 22, 2021"

Negra Modelo,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Appearance: Pours a clear, brown, bronze color. A soft, light tan head. SRM of 17. (4.00)

Aroma: Mild aromas of brown malts, caramel, brown bread, and nuts. (3.50)

Flavor: flavor follows with mild brown malt, brown bread, caramelized nuts. Only hints of cocoa. No roast. Malty, but rather dry and clean. (3.50)

Feel: Light body, moderate carbonation. Finishes clean and crisp on the palate. (3.75)

Compared to Stella Midnight Lager 5/6/21: Pours a lighter color Milder aromas/flavors. More brown bread/malts. Less cocoa/roast/smoke. 

Overall: Can't believe I'm trying this one for the first time. Very mild brown malts/bread flavors. Clean and dry too. Rather simple and not complex. Not bad, but not going to wow you. A crushable darker beer maybe. For now Current Rating: 3.61May 07, 2021"

Negra Modelo,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,"Refreshing and easy to drink, this is a nice escape if you're over run with light American and Mexican style lagers lately. It's more of a 'when in Rome' type of beer. Can't complain too much, so grab a cold one and enjoy it.Nov 27, 2020"
Negra Modelo,4.75,4.25,4.5,4.5,"Negra Modelo, deserves its name of ""the cream of the beer"", Nurtured from the foundation of a bold Munich brew that provides a subtle aroma of roasted malt and caramel with slight attack of hops. Settles into your glass with a soft copper color with a bold finish. Great friggin beer.Oct 08, 2020"
Negra Modelo,4.25,3.75,4.0,4.0,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle:

Pours a dark transparent copper color with off-white foamy head. Head fades away but retains around the circumference of the glass. Some lacing near the top.

Smell is rather subdued, which was a bit disappointing, but what you do get is pleasant. Nice combination of toasted nuts, malts, and bread.

Taste is thankfully more bold than the smell. Malts, nuts, and bread hit first, followed in the middle by a slight skunk and a minor but present hops bite. Finish is a balance of malts and the floral hops, medium length.

Carbonation helps the mouthfeel on this one. I wouldn’t call it high, but any lower and it would be too low. Smooth and drinkable. 

Overall - good Mexican representation of the German beers that inspired it. Modelo is far and away my favorite Mexican brewing company so far.Sep 13, 2020"
Negra Modelo,4.25,4.0,4.0,4.25,"The beer snobs will hate on this one because it isn’t urinated directly into their glass by a german beermeister, but remember, this is a beer you can buy in tall boy form at pretty much any gas station for 2.99 a pop. At that price point, there really isn’t anything that comes close. I like it because it’s good, it’s cheap, and easy to find. It’s also good, and cheap. Sure, it doesn’t taste exactly like a traditional Dunkel but that’s a plus for me. It’s like a Dunkel but easier to drink with less sour and bitter notes. Overall, it’s a great beer that should be celebrated more often.Sep 09, 2020"
Negra Modelo,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.75,"After all these years reviewing beers I am finally reviewing one of the most popular imports around. Has more flavor than Corona or Modelo Especial. But with that said it lacks the depth of all malt Munich Dunkels. Dark copper color with very little head. No lacing. Slightly nutty and toasty aroma but not the largest aroma. Light body and nicely carbonated. I would not mind drinking this if this is the best thing on tap at a Mexican restaurant but not good enough to be put into any sort of rotation for casual drinking.Sep 01, 2020"
Negra Modelo,4.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Pours an amber copper color with a dense creamy off-white foam head. Mild lightly dark malty taste, as it warms hints of chocolate, dark caramel, toast, molasses, almost cola, roasted nuts, dark dried fruit, and earthy herbal skunky floral hops.Aug 20, 2020"
Negra Modelo,3.0,3.0,3.25,3.0,"Sixer of 12 fl oz bottles with gold foil neck wrappers that cover their pry-off crown caps nabbed at a convenience store in New Orleans, LA. I love their snubby design/form factor.

""Medium-bodied lager with slow-roasted caramel malts brewed for a rich, smooth taste."" 5.4% ABV. Best before: FEB 2021.

Deep amber malt, bread crust/toast, treacle, toasted malt, caramel. Balanced and light to medium-bodied, lending it high drinkability. Depth of flavour isn't great, but I can't knock its balance or build...this is well within style conventions. It does have a sort of amber malt syrup/extract flavour that flirts with artificiality. Maybe 6-row is one of the base malts?

I get hints of cherry as it comes to temperature.

I don't love it, but it's better than I expected coming in. A cut above the usual North American attempts at the style, but not a beer that holds a candle to traditional German expressions.

Not much of a smell to the beer, which is kind of expected when your looking at a lager like this. No lingering after taste, very rice like taste, it's the perfect beer to down with some greasy foods!

Peroni Nastro Azzurro,4.0,2.75,2.75,4.0,"This beer only has looks going for it. It's a nice bottle and has a nice sticker, but it's like the version of Tenants in a bottle.

Peroni Nastro Azzurro,3.0,2.25,2.0,2.5,"In Boston's North End for an Italian dinner, so thought it would be cute to pair with an Italian lager. However, I was tremendously disappointed and should've ordered a red wine. I won't completely hate on it though. I think it is presented beautifully in its specific branded glass that brings out the nice shiny golden color. However the experience went downhill after that. The beer gives off a rice-like sweet aroma that turns into a slightly sweet malty corn/rice flavor. Simple and basic, but not good. Really just a watery corn juice that aged horribly as it warmed to room temperature. I will say it is crisp and refreshing, good with hearty Italian food, but someone who enjoys a flavorful brew should not expect it from this beer.May 02, 2021"

Peroni Nastro Azzurro,3.0,3.25,3.75,3.75,"I just had this bottled. I picked it up at my local craft store. The reason I purchased this was about 10 years ago we frequented a bar that had this on tap all the time and we really enjoyed it. This way a couple of years before I had ever sampled a craft beer. Ultimately I forgot all about this until I saw it in the store. I would not really categorize it as what I believe to be craft beer, rather more like a mass produced commercial beer. Although, a little fizzy it is a nice refreshing lager that has a decent taste. Very smooth tasting and light. Not any head to speak of, lacing or any typical characteristics of a craft beer, but still a good refreshing beverage with above ABV. 
I know this is not your typical review, but I recommend this beer. I wish I could find it on tap, just to compare it to the bottled brew I just downed.

Peroni Nastro Azzurro,3.5,2.75,3.0,3.25,"Phil Lewis brought some of these over when he came over swimming, and I discovered that I had not reviewed any Peroni products. That can be fixed. I had long ago made my determination that Moretti's La Rossa was the best of the Italian beers you can easily find in these parts, but it is an entirely different animal from this.

It pours with a bit of head that disappears leaving something that looks like ginger ale. Good bubbles. The aroma has me doing my Dewey Cox, I caint smell it. The taste is pretty much the same, light straw, slightly funky (green bottle syndrome) and just the lightest hops. It leaves your mouth cleaner than it started.

Not recommended. You really should avoid the style - try something more flavorful! Although I drank some inferior brews on my last trip to Europe, I was never so desperate to have to turn to this kind of stuff (there always seemed to be something more Belgian around).Jul 29, 2020"

T: very similar to the nose, sweet bread-malt peach and a light bit of grain (rice more than corn); a little earthy dirt-hop bite in the finish to help balance the sweetness up front

O: way more malt presence than I expected, to the point that I'd happily buy a six-pack of this as a slightly maltier version of a macro lager; it'd be nice if the ABV were in the lower 4s, but at least that 5.1% is coming from some decent barley malt; as a big American adjunct lager fan, I love it ... a very simple, clean, easy to drink brew with enough flavor to keep it interestingJul 12, 2020"
Peroni Nastro Azzurro,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Unpopular opinion, maybe! I really enjoy this beer - love the taste, notes... everything really. Taste buds are a bit sick of IPA and this is my go to. Can’t fault it!!Jul 10, 2020"
Peroni Nastro Azzurro,4.0,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Dealing with some IPA palate burnout has me back to drinking (and liking) pilsners and lagers. This one is basic crisp bread ness mixed with some pale malt flavors. That’s it. And that’s all I need right now staring at 90 degrees in my weather app.Jun 06, 2020"
Peroni Nastro Azzurro,4.25,2.75,2.75,3.0,"*Poured into a Teku glass from a 11.2oz bottle*

This beer poured a pale straw yellow which also provided a two finger white colored head. This had a nice diversity of rocky bubbles and had a moderate amount of retention.

The aroma was primarily off flavors, heavily smelling of diacetyl and has been slightly skunked. The diacetyl isn't too terrible of a smell, but I wished that I there was more of a malt presence in the smell. The lack of depth or any kind of complexity in the aroma makes this slightly below average in my view.

The taste follows the nose. The front palate presented the familiar diacetyl that I got from the nose and was lingering throughout. It had a bit of phenolic character presenting notes of pepper in the middle which then evolved to a malty sweetness and breadiness in the back end coupled with the ever present diacetyl.

The beer left a coating around the mouth, leaving me with a feeling that I drank butter--presumably from the diacetyl. This had a bit of an aftertaste to it, which had notes of diacetyl and sweet malts. This was light bodied and crisp making this a very drinkable beer, perfect for pairing with seafood or a tomato based dish. 

Overall, I felt like this beer wasn't bad, nowhere near the worst beer I've ever had. But the off-flavors and the weak tastes of the malts didn't really do this any favors in terms of making this beer worth while. Still, I wouldn't have a problem drinking this beer if I'm out eating some Italian food if there was nothing else to drink.May 26, 2020"
Peroni Nastro Azzurro,3.5,2.5,2.75,2.75,"I have had this beer everywhere, as this is the standard beer I have if there aren't any better options on tap.

Taste: Very slightly bitter, quite bland and unspectacular.
Feel: Feels like a carbonated drink, rather thin and watery in nature.

F: Medium-light, slight stickiness from residual sugars, bubbly, clean.

Heineken Lager Beer,4.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Heineken is one of the palest, straw colored lagers I've ever seen. The head is packed, bone white, and surprisingly lasting.

The first thing I smell are the usual pale, grainy, biscuit malts found in most even half decent lagers. Hints of ripe corn sweetness come out in the center. The finish gives a faint whiff of hops in the form of fresh cut grass.

At first blush, Heineken is smooth, crisp, and refreshing. Mouthfeel has a roundness I find pleasant in a good lager. Ripe, sweet corn combines with something that strikes me as a sort of bread or rice pudding sweetness. The finish dries out a little before leaving me wit just a hint of leafy, grassy hops.

Heineken really is a decent enough lager in its own right. My only complaints are it has the corn and rice adjunct flavors you'd expect in mainstream lagers. Also, the flavors and aromas seem kind of straightforward as though the brewery is trying to play it safe in the manufacture of this lager.May 24, 2021"

Heineken Lager Beer,1.75,2.25,2.25,2.0,"Found unopened when walking down a river while out camping. Couldn't find anyone nearby, so I decided to drink it. Poured into a mess kit cup.

L - Pours a very clear pale gold with a one-finger off-white/pearl head. Head disappears very quickly.
S - Miscellaneous cereal grains, some sort of tartness, and a bit of a fruit I can't really pin down. Perhaps unripe citron? A little bit of a toasted white bread in there, as well.
T - Grass, stale saltines, and biscuit. A faint - almost diluted - floral note is present. Not much else, other than a not-too-overwhelming sweetness. Even though this was a bottle of the stuff, it tastes like someone dropped a nickel into it.
F - Refreshing, very carbonated, and light. Not like a light beer sort of ""light"", but more watery than beer-y. Crisp, too.
O - If La Croix ever got into the beer business, this would be their flagship brew. It isn't terrible, but it isn't really great, either. Pretty good for a free beer, but not much else. I would imagine this would pair very well with canned sardines (King Oscar's, for sure) and onions. I've had this before, but I've never in my life had to ever buy it to have it. I'll continue this trend by saying I wouldn't buy it, but I wouldn't mind finding it alongside a river again.May 18, 2021"
Heineken Lager Beer,2.75,2.75,2.75,2.75,"I used to appreciate its crisp citrus perfumed aroma, often accompanied by a fresh seafood meal - but alas, I grew tired of it. I'm not the only one. It once was a half-decent local brand in the Netherlands, but those days are gone - its position as international swill is firm. However, the beer is not undrinkable, and I won't turn down a fresh glass from tap on a sunny day.Apr 23, 2021"
Heineken Lager Beer,2.5,2.25,2.75,2.0,"Look: Pours a fizzy, golden yellow color with a one finger satin white head of foam. Minimal lacing. 

Aroma: Sweet corn and mild sour apple. There's a bit of complexity to the malt bill, mostly notes of caramel and toasted bread trying to come through on the nose, but it gets stifled by the aforementioned aromas of sweet corn and sour apple.

Taste: Fairly generic and non-descript flavors of; you guessed it, sweet corn and apples. There's a small floral, bitter, grassy hop note to it, attempting to round out the initial flavors. The sugar content is somewhat abrasive and kind of dominates the entire experience.

Feel: Mid-heavy body (for a lager). High carbonation. The beer feels very syrupy sweet on the palate, and if not for the high carbonation to sort of lighten it up, it would feel extremely heavy bodied.

Overall: I feel bad giving this such low marks, but it had to be done. I'd really like to rate this higher, but I would be being dishonest. For what it's worth I've certainly had much worse. My main problem with this beer is how sweet and heavy bodied it is, despite being fairly well carbonated. Still; I'd drink it in a pinch and I do find myself buying a case every now and again.Mar 07, 2021"
Heineken Lager Beer,2.5,2.0,2.5,3.0,"Heineken is fine. It’s that category of beer that depends entirely on what you drink around it. Drink it alone and it had a degree of maltiness, but drink it after any remotely flavourful beer and it disappears. I’m reviewing this as my fourth beer and it definitely disappears. Look and taste are in the middle as it is certainly average - there is nothing to dislike here - and mouthfeel provides a little structure based on the carbonation. 

I didn’t check the can but I presume this is brewed locally in China based on its prevalence here. This is a standard China fallback beer; the McDonalds of Beers - get it when you need a benchmark of flavour and quality, no matter your expectations.Feb 23, 2021"
Heineken Lager Beer,2.0,3.0,2.25,1.25,"Reviewing the high school beers again.
Looks pretty standard. Very clear yellow with little head that is symmetrical which is usually a bad sign and 0 lacing.
Smells actually like malt!! Significantly better aromatics than any of the other high big beer ""lager"" adjuncts so hey that's not too bad. However, the malt is suuuuper diluted. Very sparse and there might be a little bit in the way of grassy tones but there is very very little going on here. Faintly bready diluted malt character.
The taste on this beer is pretty bad. Skunky malt. The ""crisp pop"" of this beer is pretty insignificant when compared to any decent IPA or really any hoppy beer. Maybe some earthy tones but not really. Very watery.
The mouthfeel is oddly high carbonation with no thickness. Very weird and fizzy.

Overall this beer is actually not the worst in the world if you live in a swamp in the middle of nowhere and don't have access to anything creative from the craft world. It's better than the other cheap mass produced beers but that's not saying a whole lot. On par with pabst, better than budweiser, worse than grolsch.Feb 22, 2021"
Heineken Lager Beer,3.5,3.5,4.25,4.25,"I don’t know why this brew gets so much hate here. The taste of your Heineken depends on whether that case is skunked or not. If skunked, it sucks. If fresh, this is a crisp, tasty, enjoyable beer that you can easily throw back several of. I’ve heard the skunkiness comes from the green bottles which let in more light than brown ones. Whatever, I’m gonna keep enjoying my ice cold Heinekens.Jan 08, 2021"
Heineken Lager Beer,2.75,2.5,2.75,2.5,"The classic, go to, staple of the Euro lager field. It’s the only beer your uncle will drink. It’s the “premium” beer your dad drinks instead of Bud.

Heineken Lager Beer,5.0,2.0,1.5,4.5,"Re-reviewing on 1/5/21 after originally giving it a 3.67 (5/3/3.5/4.5/4) on 12/23/20

I honestly don't know what got me with the flavor of Heineken when I first tried it. It may have had a lot to do with the fact that it was something new, something I'd never tried before, but it was also popular. I don't know. But it tastes a lot different now, a bit less than 2 weeks later.

Truth be told, I don't really like Heineken. It still looks and feels fine, and I still enjoy the bubbles quite a bit. However, for a 5% abv lager with 142 calories, not only can I come up with a dozen better brews that I would enjoy more with around the same alcoholic content and less calories, but I also can't justify the price being around $1 per can. The main issue with it comes afterwards: the odd, unfitting sweetness that tops off each sip both at the very end and slightly after as an aftertaste. It reminds me way too much of Bud Light, which to me is close to undrinkable unless I'm already drunk (or at a party).

I do thoroughly believe the people who say that it's better in Holland though; heck, a somewhat close friend of mine is from a rural area in Germany and says Heineken is far and beyond one of the best beers he can get in his town. I think the big thing for me though, as much as certain brews might be better in their own home country than imported, I actually still enjoy a lot of them imported (Guinness is a good example). Heineken though, I can't say I like it all that much beyond the first maybe second and a half after pouring it into my mouth. It has a somewhat nice flavor at that point and is very bubbly, but the moment my tongue soaks it up and I begin to swallow is when it all goes downhill.

I'd love to try Heineken locally (or at least in Europe in general), but as far as it goes here in America, I'm gonna be skipping the Heineken from now on. Really disappointed as well, as I thought I'd found my new favorite ""cheap and you can get it anywhere"" beer when I first tried it. Sad times.Dec 23, 2020"

Heineken Lager Beer,3.75,3.75,4.25,4.25,"Alright, I'll write a decent review for once.
Look: Poured in a stein glass, with a thick foamy head that eventually recedes to a decent little line.. Light yellow color.
Smell: I don't know, I usually dive right in. Who has time to smell it? It smells like straws and hops, I guess.
Taste: Quintessential characteristics of a European style mass produced lager - malts, hops, a savory beer.
Feel: Smooth palate, no harshness to it at all. 
Overall: Heineken boasts that you can find this beer just about anywhere globally, and what other beer out there deserves that kind of outreach? You IPA loving manchildren can sneer at this beer all you want. I'm gonna eat a medium cheeseburger or pepperoni and jalapeno pizza with this by my side, and love every minute of it. This is a fine easy drinking lager, obviously I've had better beers like German pilsners that were brewed in some dude's basement that adhered religiously to the German Purity Laws of 1516, but this is the standard European lager.Nov 13, 2020"

Mouthfeel: Light, high carbonation, decently full – not really what I would call watery, and clean and crisp throughout
Overall: You could do a lot worse for an easy-drinking, crisp lager that I could quaff all day. Not huge in the flavor or aroma department but it was expected as that comes with the territory of the style.

Heineken Lager Beer,1.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,"The power of big business and marketing! There are people that believe they are drinking something really special. The good stuff!

Not worth the calories. No payoff of anything notable or enjoyable about drinking Heineken. The only apparent quality is green bottled skunk funk. There is an awareness of missed opportunity and regret; I could be drinking something good even within this style which I find rather boring.

It goes without saying that I never order or think about buying this mundane brew. Sometimes I am given one. I keep it around for people who just don't care or know that there are far better beers out there. 

I was cleaning my balcony and discovered a long forgotten Heineken that a neighbor gave me earlier in the summer. Normally an un-opened bottle of beer floating in the slimy water in the cooler would be a happy discovery. Get it cold and crack it open! That is if it were not a Heineken. Suppose I can clean it up and give it back to my neighbor as a small gesture of good neighborliness . Probably the most impressive thing about this brew is that the label remains. Again, great marketing.Sep 07, 2020"
Heineken Lager Beer,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Where Belgian lagers tent to be a bit watery and some Germans too, Heineken has a strong taste which is reminiscent of the exquisite pints like the Czech Urquel and German Jever, that coincidentally both also come in a green bottle. The green color adds to the resemblance of the taste . I would even go as far as to call Heineken a Czech style of beer, which naturally is a good thing.

Overall, I shouldn't be too harsh, as this looks like the kind of beer you'd have at a game, or at a tailgate, and I assume that's exactly what this beer is trying to be. 

Aroma is not bad, there's just very little to work with. I'm not super sensitive to diacetyl, but I'm certainly picking it up here.

T - Dirty pennies, potato bread, and a faint floral backing. Rather sweet. Canned pineapple aftertaste.
F - Medium carbonation. Refreshing, and surprisingly light-bodied.
O - After drinking this with a friend of mine, I've never wanted to go to the beach more. On its own, I'd say it's pretty average, but this beer would likely change based on the atmosphere it's served in. Sounds stupid probably, but if you drink it, you'll get it. Refreshing for sure, and I'd imagine it'd pair well with fish tacos. Will purchase again.Apr 05, 2021"
Big Wave Golden Ale,3.75,4.0,3.5,3.25,"2oz bottled 19DEC20 (4 months ago) poured into a bow tie glass at fridge temp 4.4% ABV. The beer pours bright golden amber in color with nearly white head. The head recedes to a thin ring and single layer of bubbles. Slight lacing. The aroma is faint with a hint of sweet pineapple. The taste is semisweet, light caramel, more pineapple with additional tropical fruit in the background. Minimal bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Overall, good for style. Not really my thing with the fruitiness and there is a hint of unpleasant aftertaste, as if the fermentation was rushed.Mar 27, 2021"
Big Wave Golden Ale,4.25,3.75,4.0,4.25,"I’m not going to roast this beer. 
Here is the style category per ba: 

“One of the most approachable styles, a golden or Blonde Ale is an easy-drinking beer that is visually appealing and has no particularly dominating malt or hop characteristics. Rounded and smooth, it is an American classic known for its simplicity. Sometimes referred to as “Golden Ale.”

Big Wave Golden Ale,2.75,3.75,4.0,2.5,"The beer is a golden color with a small head and decent lacing. On the nose it smells bready and floral. There is a cornmuffin note, but without the corn. Maybe a hint of diactyl, but its not bad. On the palate, it is full bodied slight sweet beard flavor. The butteriness is there, but it works well with the bready flavor. The hops are floral and slightly bitter. the floral nature is green, like a flower bud. The mouthfeel isn't spectacular. the beer is there and foamy. the body isn't great.

Hackenberg Pils Lager,2.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,"Appearance: Poured from a can into a Hoegaarden pint glass in Galway, Ireland, on October 25th, 2010. Pours a clear bright yellow with a pathetic two finger head that appears thin and without cream. At least it doesn't look overcarbonated. 

Smell: A light note of malted barley. Not unpleasant but not bold. 

Taste: A rather pleasant note of cream I didn't expect, and a quite nice balance thereafter, but the build is a bit too sweet especially towards the finish. 

Mouthfeel: Some lovely cream on the open. A bit too wet up until the finish, but I want more. The finish goes coarse towards the end but stays wet. Interesting. 

Drinkability: I didn't expect this from a budget beer (even if it is from Belgium). For the price and 5.00% abv, it don't get much better.Oct 25, 2010"

L - Motor oil brown all the way through; a massive four-finger yeasty and thick tan head.
S - Fig, raisin, plum, and dark breads. A bit of cacao and a dry caramel aroma.
T - Stone fruit and burnt toast at first, then leading into a wonderfully complex fig and lightly-roasted coffee. Caramel is faint but present. Dry cacao throughout. Flavors slowly fade out into a dry raisin, and finish with toffee and walnut. Everything almost hints at sweetness, but it isn't sweet.
F - Thick. Boozy towards the end. Filling. Full body, light carbonation.

Trappistes Rochefort 10,5.0,4.25,4.25,4.5,"Found this dusty on a shelf in my local deli, who knows how long it was there. Probably a really long time from the way it looked and the way the handwritten price was scrawled on a little round sticky on the top of this single. $5.49 it said. Must be a good price for a beer that has a 100/100 rating here. I'm very excited to try it as it's my first Trappist ale. Poured out into a clean snifter, light golden as it poured and darkening as it collected in the bottom of the glass. Nice inch of flaxen head that sticks around in a fluffy layer floating on top. Scent reminds me of banana and raisins predominantly and maybe some orange and grapefruit too. As i swirl the glass, the head foams up again robustly. Upon the first sip, I'm not as terribly impressed as i expected to be. Strong malt backbone, candies of butterscotch and sugary burnt bananas predominate. Also raisins, dates, figs. But it's also somewhat bitter with an earthy, musty type taste to it. Somewhat leathery. The 11% is well hidden and doesn't come through too strongly. Comes with a dry finish. Mouthfeel is full, well rounded, and highly carbonated. Overall it's a pretty good brew, but won't receive my highest marks. It's perhaps that I'm not trying several beers of this style in a row to pick the best. Perhaps my palate is still young and inexperienced. But regardless of what others say, I have to decide for myself. i tend to like big, heavy, thick, dense beers, with robust abvs, and maybe i was expecting the taste of a stout or porter. My only reference for this beer is really Golden Monkey, which I could just as easily pour if I wanted a beer of this style. Glad i tried it as it was quite the experience given the anticipation i had for this beer. However, i'm off to sample something a little heavier.Mar 13, 2021"

Clean and crisp, with many complex subtleties that other have already described better than I could. It does a pretty good job of masking its ABV too, so be careful.

Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,"Opened a 2 1/4 year bottle that had been in my refrigerator for just about as long.

Pours a dark translucent brown with a fair amount of sediment. Initially the light tan head is tall and fluffy. It subsides to a light ring.

Smells of bread, yeast , brown sugar and raisins. Tastes of yeast, spice and raisins with a slightly bitter finish. The high alcohol level hides very well contributing some heat to the end of each sip.

Medium body and carbonation. Lush mouthfeel but lighter than I would have expected for a beer with such a big character.

This one deserves its World-Class ribbon !Nov 07, 2020"
Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.25,4.0,4.25,4.25,"As is the trend with all the Rocheforts, this has a muddle turbid appearance, with a slightly darker prune juice hue of brick red to brown, under a moderate, less active tan head that's softly convex, settling to a densely blanket that retains well.

Aroma is more subtle and restrained, but also mildly hoppy, while taste follows suit in that it is far more drinkable than 8, despite its slightly stronger ABV. I'm getting notes of sticky toffee pudding with fig and mincemeat via a moderately light but silky body whose carbonation is tingly and fine but expandingly airy, before coming to a semi-dry finish that has a slight prick of numbing heat. A second visit brings a touch of molasses and ginger snaps with hints of caramelized brown sugar, yet it remains slightly bitter by a lightly charred sort of element.

This is a far more balanced brew with a more deft hand and clearly--aside from its strength, which was probably a big deal in its day--this balance is what has kept its reputation so high.Oct 30, 2020"
Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,"This is a wonderful Quad, but the alcohol notes are a bit hot for me. I typically prefer sub 10% beers and have enjoyed 'worse' quads more because there are a bit cooler. Highly recommend for an experience, but not a favorite.Oct 21, 2020"

L: Really, really dark brown, borderline black, hard to see through. Creamy, frosty 1 finger head. Holds nice lacing.

S: The first smell, I get the same kind of characteristics I got from the Rochefort 6 and 8 - caramel, nutty. Although this one is different, there's dates, raisins, some hint of dark cherries singing in the background. A chocolate-rum (sign of some alcohol) cake nods its head and welcomes for a bite. In the distant horizon, a banana, cream kind of flavour shines through, maybe its my imagination?

T: I mean.. the nose was definitely interesting, but the taste blew me away. How this caramel, nutty, honey glazed toffe, banana, nuts, and everything else are so well balancend and easy drinking? From smelling I thought maybe its going to be a bit better than the middle brother, Rochefort 8, but it was really, really good.. Definitely tastes better than it smells.

F: So smooth, very well balanced, medium/high body, creamy nectar. 11.3% ABV? no way..

O: After drinking 6 and 8 from the family, which weren't that special, I expected that this is going to be a bit better, but not this good.

Appearance: The body is a medium shade of gold with a good deal of haze. Slightly fuzzy shadows are visible through the beer. It has a large and fluffy white head with the consistency of soap suds. Very good retention and lacing.

Aroma: There is a pleasant perfume of coriander and orange zest with a hint of vanilla.

Taste: Up front there is a presence of tangy orange. As it passes over the tongue it picks up some wheat character. Coriander pops in near the rear of the palate and lingers a bit as it rolls off the back of the tongue.

Mouthfeel: It is well carbonated and feels light on the tongue but textured. No real bitterness. There is a light tangy bite to the beer which keeps things interesting.

Overall: The highlight of the beer is the wonderful aroma that is packed with a great perfume of coriander and orange while keeping it restrained enough to allow it to be delicate. The flavors are a near-equal match to the aroma, sacrificing a little bit of the vanilla aroma but bringing forth some pleasant but mild wheat character. It is an extremely enjoyable beer and I would highly recommend it and I would definitely drink it again.Sep 16, 2021"

Pours a moderately hazy light yellow with a big head and lots of carbonation. Smell is wit -- nice graininess, some yeast, a little spiciness that I'm mapping to cloves and maybe black pepper, hint of fruitiness that makes me think of banana.

Taste is pretty similar, banana and black pepper is a little stronger, might get a little lemon. Moderate sweetness, actually a little bit of bitterness to finish it off which works nicely.

The aroma is of citrus & banana just like your typical wheat beer & the taste follows suit & along with a fair amount of spices like coriander in the backend mouthfeel. If you're a fan of wheat beer like me then you most likely you would like this beer & it's a readily available wheat beer for me. Cheers! A-Aug 04, 2019"
Blanche,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"BdC has long been on my short list of best witbiers for years, but I don't drink wits too much these days and typically don't really return to Unibroue due to poor format and same-y selection (though their beers are mostly all great, don't get me wrong). However, seeing this in a four pack 16 oz can format for under $10 made me excited to snap it up again to relive my first experiences with it, which were probably 7-8 years ago at this point. Damn, how time flies!

Pour is incredible on this beautiful brew. A semi-hazy pale golden colored beer erupts from the can with a huge collar of stable white foam measuring almost three fingers of pure suds before settling down to about a finger and a half with excellent legs. Each small pour re-rouses the head into another plush, dense-looking mountain. So nice looking and inviting.

The nose of this beer is subtly different from most other witbiers (especially the big commercial ones like Blue Moon and Shock Top), as it features Unibroue's expressive, delicately-spicy yeast alongside the typical additions of coriander and orange peel as adjunct ingredients. Slightly buttery with a clove-like bent and some crackery undertones, BdC just has a really nice smell to it that screams ""summer thirst quencher."" Almost has a tart note with some orchard fruits underneath as well. Just great.

On the palate, this comes off as almost a lighter version of Unibroue's very own Don de Dieu, though it has a bit more citrus and less of a thick, wheat-laden palate. I'd almost say this feels a little watery for a 5% witbier. The floral and citrusy coriander melds well with the wheat base and brings out some light lemon zest and lemongrass elements at times. A bit herbal and grassy with zippy carbonation and a nice, semi-sweet swallow. The can mentions a ""good sugar/acidity balance"" and I can agree with that. There almost is a little bit of tart acidity in here; obviously it's not a sour beer, but there's a light touch of something in the beginning of the palate that might have to do with the combination of the yeast and the adjuncts that feels a little different than other similar-strength wits. Overall, this is a fun and easy-drinking beer featuring Unibroue's expressive yeast. As many other reviewers have mentioned, it doesn't reinvent the wheel, as it were, but it makes some modifications to the style that you may find pleasant if you enjoy Unibroue's other offerings and their trademark yeast.Jul 20, 2019"

Cloudy, pale gold colored body with two fingers of white head. The head settles back to a creamy, small bubble cap. Leaves behind some spotty patterns of lacing.

Taste certainly expresses the orange and coriander. The wheat base provides the tang and crispness. Good bready yeast in the finish.

Blanche,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a conical pint glass; best by 01/18/21.
A: Pours a slightly hazy, golden color, with very exuberant head formation, a one to two finger, white head formation, solid half finger retention, but limited lacing.
S: Pungent and tart. Aromas of citrus, coriander, cloves, and caramel malt. 
T: Semisweet. Coriander and cloves it the palate initially followed by a complex mix of the elements of nose. Don't quite perceive the orange, but definitely a citrusiness. Bitterness is nicely in balance with the whole.
M: Light to medium bodied with solid persistent effervescence.
O: Blanche de Chambly is a light, delicious take on Belgian Witbier. Drinkable and highly enjoyable. Could be ""The World's Best White Beer.""Jul 07, 2019"
Blanche,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,"Look: Slightly hazy copper-straw color. Pours a head with small bubbles that drops down to a thick skiff across the top of the glass after a minute. No lacing. Starts with medium sized bubbles on the side of the glass. Active carbonation with a lot of mostly small bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass.

Smell: Mostly fruit, tending towards orange citrus. Very slight gingerbread spice. Swirling the glass kicked up more spice and a touch of partially composted grass.

Taste: Light fruit flavors, again tending towards citrus. A bit of peppery spice. Slightly sweet and sour towards the middle. The flavors carry on long into the aftertaste.

Feel: Slight tongue tingling as it quickly grows to a foam of medium bubbles.

Overall: Lighter body than most of their products. Very nice blend of flavors built with a soft touch. Could drink this every day instead of as a special treat.Jun 24, 2019"
Blanche,4.0,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Decided to return to some old favorites to see how they had survived the Sapporo takeover. The Blanche is still good - pale straw with a rich creamy head.

Blanche,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Look: Hazy yellow with two fingers of thick white head. 

Smell: Wheat, lemon and orange peel, soapy hops.

Blanche,4.5,4.25,4.0,4.25,"Poured into a tall clear pint glass. Hazy light amber with a pillowy, fluffy 1 1/2 finger thick head with good retention and lacing. Some floaters are present, bubbles slowly go up ominously. 

Aroma has many spices and smells very sweet. All around welcoming. Notes of orange peel, coriander, crackers, some yeast, bread, cloves, lemon peel, and of course wheat.

Dried orange peel and lemon peel, coriander, wheat, and bread malts upfront. Much like the aroma, it all comes around. Feels smooth, moderate carbonation.Feb 19, 2019"

BrewDog Punk IPA,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"poured from a can into a clean pint glass settles to an orange tinged yellow. head at about an half inch then slowly dissipates. overwhelming first sniff of indistinct fruit and chemicals, couple of sniffs in then I think you could claim to smell lychee. unfamiliar initial taste,like out of place and heavy flavoured fruit water, light carbonation like a warm sparkling water. slight burn on the back of the throat on the swallow then eventually a taste of ale that is bitter and that then unpleasantly lingers. I cannot understand the fuss, the hype , supposed popularity or the price. Willing to admit the colder it is drank the easier it is to tolerate, just like extremely chilled cheap white wine would be tolerable, if not broken why try to fix an IPA ?Sep 02, 2021"

Light straw with mild haze. White head quickly fades to thin ring.
Light nose of indeterminate tropical fruit with some citrus notes.
Palate is similar with a rather thin mouthfeel and light carbonation.
A very dialled down NEIPA, lacking depth and complexity. I would have thought this was a Pale Ale in a blind test.Aug 12, 2021"
BrewDog Punk IPA,3.5,3.0,3.25,3.25,"Pours a hazy straw color with a small quickly receding white head. 
I struggled to get much from the aroma other than a little cracker malt and vague citrus, even after letting it warm in the glass. 
Flavor was a bit of letdown as well. Muted juicy tropical fruit taste and not much else. 
Mouthfeel is a bit watery could use more carbonation maybe. 
I bought this as a single can with low expectations. It did not live up to them.Jun 07, 2021"

BrewDog Punk IPA,3.5,3.75,4.0,4.0,"Poured from a 12 ounce can into a pint glass. Less than a finger of slightly off-white head with small bubbles. Nose is of lemon peel and citrus with some biscuit malts. Beer is hazy golden orange. The taste is lemon peel with a nice biscuit malt flavor, and very slight bitterness. A solid beer that is less bitter and sweet than most IPAS but not bad over all.Jan 26, 2021"
BrewDog Punk IPA,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Poured into a tall clear pint glass. Clear marigold color with more than a finger's worth of sticky white head. Good retention and lacing.

Aroma is quite fruity. Notes of lemon peel, orange, tangerine, grapefruit, banana, strawberry, mango, passion fruit pineapple, and biscuit malt.

Taste the biscuit malt well, fruit notes mentioned above play a somewhat sweet role but the citrus comes out on top with the malt. A tiny bit bitter and sweet. Body is medium-light.Jan 24, 2021"
BrewDog Punk IPA,3.75,3.5,3.75,4.25,"Brewdog holds true to their fruity and juicy notes with Punk IPA.

This IPA pours a golden hazy orange color. A gread head of white hair adorns the glass. Tall and long lasting like it's straight from the 80s.

There's nothing Rancid about this sweet smelling beer. Much like Brewdog's other varieties I get a not-so-Misfit collection of orange, tangerine and grapefruit notes. Not too earthy though and I do like a muskier scent.

Compared to Elvisjuice or Clockwork Tangerine this Brewdog Offspring falls a little flat for me on taste. It's not bad, at all. But I was hoping for more fruit or more hops.

Punk IPA brings about no Clash to your tastebuds. A fresh and light feel with medium carbonation has NOFX of a bad aftertaste. Easy to drink!

This is a solid beer. It isn't amazing. But it is far from bad. One glass has me revving up and ready to go for another. Hey, ho! Let's go!Dec 27, 2020"

poured a nice 1to 2finger head into glass that stayed there for awhile then left a lace as you drink it. 
smell and taste is amazing its less sweet lighter fruits and less bitter then most IPAS very smooth and creamy tasting also. almost like a cream ale 
overall this Punk IPA beer from Brewdog is amazing I'm glad I bought 2 cans .
going back for more at only 2.95 a can good price

BrewDog Punk IPA,4.0,3.75,3.5,4.0,"Another one from this brewer that I found juicy AF...

I really enjoyed this offering. Decent colored IPA with copious amounts of lacing down the glass. The smell was muted - fruity with oranges and lemon-peel, with a mouthfeel that was light-bodied, crisp, but overly carbonated even as it warmed. The taste was very much hop-forward, distracting from all the fruity scents you know were there for the tongue as well. Overall, it's a solid brew, not the best IPA out there but a great representative on the style.Nov 29, 2020"
BrewDog Punk IPA,4.5,4.5,3.75,4.0," oz can, born on 8/20/20, into Southern Grist mini beecher. 

Pours a foggy hazy champagne color with a tall shaving cream-like head of 2 fingers. Leaves gorgeous gloppy lace as it recedes. 

Some damn fine aromas here with strawberry and wet grass opening it up, slight banana, orange muffin, blueberries, and tangerine. 

Flavor opens up with orange and orange pith, then moves on to wet grass, straw, wheat, pine, yellow grapefruit, banana peel, lemon rind, a little bit of strawberry and clove, and finally dry grass on the finish. A little bit of wheat on the breath. The first sip is orgasmic, the follow up sips build harsh resins on the palate and dirty it up a bit. 

Feel is great for a session IPA - crispy, tight, busy carbonation, very mild alcohol tingle, and a moderate (perhaps just a touch too much) hop resin that lays on the tongue and cheeks. 

Overall, I personally think this is a stellar beer. It's nearly like a Belgian IPA. It's got clove and wheat and has that Witbier thing kinda going for it. Considering its age, it has held up well. I'd have it again. 

Price paid : $1.50 a can I think
Would buy again : yesNov 09, 2020"
BrewDog Punk IPA,3.75,3.5,3.75,4.0,"Gold in color with excellent clarity. There’s a half inch of frothy beige on top. Minimal lacing. The aroma is of lemon and lime. I’m tasting pineapple, lemon, and lime. The mouth is very light and yet crisp and refreshing.Oct 17, 2020"

BrewDog Punk IPA,2.5,3.75,2.75,2.75,"Fuzzy amber colour, one finger head Taste of slightly off grapefruit and lychee. I don't care for lychees personally. Tart feeling on the mouth but fades away quickly. I expected it to be more bitter. Have tried a few times and this brew sometimes doesn't taste the same in different batches Not bad for a change but personally prefer IPAs to be 6% or over and more bitterJun 13, 2020"
BrewDog Punk IPA,3.5,4.0,3.75,3.75,"look: one finger white head which quickly dissipates to a thin layer of bubbles, no lacing really, beer is a clear amber colour with only a few bubbles rising through it.

smell: quite a nice smelling ipa, lots of juicy fruity flavours, mango, passion fruit, lychee, orange, lemon zest, pink grapefruit, some vanilla, sweet but not too sweet, some malty flavours, a touch bready, caramel, smells good.

taste: a perfectly nice ipa, good bit of malt flavour at first, brown bread, biscuit, caramel, then those fruit flavours come through, passion fruit, pineapple and orange dominate, then there’s a nice hop hit on the finish, not jam-packed with flavour but very well balanced.

feel: light bodied, light to medium carbonation, totally sessionable, very drinkable, smooth, nice bitter sensations on the back of the tongue.

overall: a perfectly acceptable ipa, one which i can’t believe it’s taken me so long to have given how abundant it is.Jun 06, 2020"
BrewDog Punk IPA,3.75,1.5,1.75,3.0,"Soapy. Whenever I smell or taste an IPA, I get a big dose of soap. Apparently that's how some people perceive the aroma and I must be among them.

BrewDog Punk IPA,4.25,4.0,4.25,3.75,"Slightly hazy golden color with a white head, there are citrus notes on the nose, and an enticing malt note.

BrewDog Punk IPA,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Poured into a small chalice: color is gold, a good bit of haze, frothy head off white in color, some lacing and lingering top. 

Smell is really subdued - some pale malt and herbal, grassy hops, light citrus, but really had to warm up to get it going.

Taste has more to offer with pale malt, some caramel, herbal/grassy/earthy hops, some citrus, malt comes through again towards end.

Mouthfeel is moderately carbonated, solid bitterness, light drying finish.

Budweiser Budvar,4.0,3.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer is generally among the best beers produced in Czechia. It would be bad if it wasn’t so, because it’s the national brewery.

It’s a bit sweeter but it surprisingly doesn’t ruin the beer as a whole product. It’s color is a bit like mandarine and you can feel a bit of the fruit tones in this beer as it’s sweeter than most other beers. 

I personally really like this beer and would recommend buying if you want to try representative and classic Czech beer with a tradition!Aug 09, 2021"
Budweiser Budvar,3.75,3.5,4.25,4.0,"This beer is kind of like a rabbit. Sweet, smooth like it's fur and just the right hop. A flowery, clean smelling golden lager with average carbonation.

Budweiser Budvar,5.0,2.75,3.75,4.5,"From US exported pint can.
Appearance: Golden. Very clear. 1cm head forms upon pouring, dissipating to virtually nothing. 

Aroma: Grainy with low-medium spicy hop undertones. Some malt sweetness.

Flavor: Spice / floral hop flavor right away, quickly fading to malty / grainy flavors. Some sweetness detected, but really a nuanced sweetness (not cloying) and definitely must be searched for. Retro-nasal is a toasty malt, fading quickly. Very low sulfur notes.

Mouthfeel: Fuller feel than most lighter-styled lagers, but refreshing and as I noted above, not a cloying sweetness- balanced. Medium to moderate carbonation. 

Overall: I feel like the aroma could have a little more hop character. The flavor is really nice. I really like the fact that I can buy this in a can, rather than bottle. I feel the beer is more in line with what the brewer intended.Feb 14, 2021"

Budweiser Budvar,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Medium head, dark yellow body. Smells of flour, dough, some floral hops. Taste is a great balance of stiff hop taste and malts, quite yeasty for the style also. Body is full and mouthfeel is malty and crisp with slight bitterness. 
I like to drink this straight out of the bottle. A go to amongst super market beers and one of my regulars. However probably not as good as it's Czech rival Urquell and there are a number of German pilsners that are superior. Very good lager nonetheless.Jul 07, 2020"
Budweiser Budvar,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,"Unknown age into a pilsner glass. Gorgeous fluffy white head with good retention that falls quickly into strong lacing. Admirable carbonation and a clean gold color as well. The nose is funky hop and breadcrumb, maybe some dry cracker too. The taste is funky hop flowers and grassy grass up front, transitioning into bready sweetness and a finish of crisp sour cracker and citrus zest zing. The mouthfeel is expectedly dry and quick, leaving one thirsty for more Czechvar!

This is a fantastic imported Czech lager, and really nails the style for me.Jul 07, 2020"
Budweiser Budvar,3.75,5.0,4.0,3.75,"""Always Czech Brewed"" Every beer should be brewed by the makers, all this sub licencing is bollocks and wrong...respect to them. For example non-Polish Tyskie is terrible, but Polish is top totch.

Head stays up well, beautiful and very witheld fizzing, kind of unique.

Aroma is heavenly, hoppy and flowery...really beautiful, wow.

Taste compared with aroma is a bit disappointing., as that was the best aroma ever. However it is still a unique and beautiful flavour...kind of surprised I did not have this sooner.

As a lager, this is one of the best I have ever had. No doubt. The floweryness has a bitterness that balances well, so it is not feminine, just a perfect balance of orgasm between 2 different elements. 

Not as good as most IPA's, though as a Euro lager, possibly the best...

To improve...more hops/bitterness, and more alcohol...a bit less floweryness...

For me this is by far the best pilsner in the world, no contest. Better than Pilsner Urquell and much better than Staropramen, and all German/Polish pilsners.Jun 21, 2020"
Budweiser Budvar,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Pours a clear, deep golden coloration with a large, fluffy, lasting head. Smells of doughy, slightly grainy malt and grassy, floral hops. Taste is a good balance of doughy, grainy malt and grassy, floral hops, with just a hint of a certain, hard to define, fruitiness also coming through. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some grassy, floral hops lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.

A rather nice Pilsner that is perhaps a little bland, but well-balanced and easy-drinking, with a crisp and dry character, good bitterness and even hints of a certain, fruity berry note. What I like about this is the grainy aspect of the malts, preventing this from becoming too sweet and the grassy hop presence somewhat outweighting the floral one, as well as that very subtle, slight fruitiness.Jun 10, 2020"
Budweiser Budvar,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.25,"Pretty beer. Crystal clear, mild carbonation. Slight yeast smell. Taste is more hops than expected for a pilsner, maybe the Czech style. Refreshing on a spring afternoon, nothing exceptional.Jun 03, 2020"
Budweiser Budvar,3.25,2.75,2.75,3.0,"Bought at the Supermarket in Olomouc (Czech Republic). Poured from a 0,5 l can to a Pilsener Glass.

-Look is the usual of a Pilsener though less transparent, Columns of bubbles cannot be seen.
-Smell is non-existent in comparision with usual Pilseners. Though I wouldn't describe it as bad, it cannot be felt. After a while, the oxidation may provoke soe bitterness after a while.
-You can feel bitterness. Light though less Pilsener-tasty than other Pilseners.
-Feel is light. Carbonation cannot be feeled.

It is an okay beer. The Czech scene can provide better examples, though I would say it is recommendable for summer days or heavy foods.May 25, 2020"

Budweiser Budvar,4.5,4.0,5.0,5.0,"This is the original Budweiser Beer. But in US cannot be called that, so it is sold as Czechvar. However hardly similar to the US version, a lot stronger, with strong malt and hop taste. One of my favorites. Honey color, somewhat sweet taste. Made from barley, hops and water only. Best tasting fresh on tap in south Bohemia. Unfortunately, like most Czech beers, it does not travel that well. Warning: It does not send and warnings signals to stop, After consuming two gallons from tap and feeling great, I just collapsed and got totally wasted! The worst I have ever got drunk from the beer! Most beers send a lot of warning signals before you get wasted, this one does not! I was told that this is the feature of this beer and common problem.

The mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Very clean with minimal skunky flavors or smells. Overall, very good. Very authentic Czech pilsner.

Nice malts up front with a silky body and a mostly balanced throughout, leaning towards the malts. I can drink this all day not like that beechwood aged crap.

A clear light orange with a dense, white head with great retention and lacing, this looks great. The nose has a blend of lemony and mildly skunky hops, with a noticeable bitterness present. There is a light pils-like bready malt note present. The palate opens mildly bitter and mildly skunky, with earth, lemon, skunk, a little lemon resin and a touch of grass. This is followed by a mild pils malt flavor, deep and rich in the way that suggests multiple decoctions.

T- Gorgeous. It has a good medium body into some malts. The flavour is also distinctive; I'm saying that from the perspective of this being one of my top-5 favourite beers - I could drink this until the cows come home, it's that all-around good and 'sessionable'.
M- Dry on the finish, beautiful balance, it is a very well constructed beer.
O- A fantastic high quality all-rounder. A perfect summer beer. If I'm on a session I'll often start with one of these as it is quite subtle [if you have congestion or are a smoker you might miss out on the intricacies of this beer]. The only thing I'm left wondering is how I've managed to drink 100's of these, but it's only today I realised I've never reviewed it!
BB 28/06/29. %00ml bottle bought from Waitrose, London.

ps. The 'Beer info' in the headers is confusing, it refers to this beer as 'Czechvar'. That is what it is sold as in the US. Reason being Anheuser Busch took the Czech brewery to court to stop them them branding this as Budweiser within the US. (Ironic since it was a member of the Budvar brewery family who emigrated long ago to the US, and started brewing what has now ended up as US Budwesier!
Also, looking through a few pages of reviews below, it seems some people might be mistaking this for the US imposter and hence (obviously) down-rating it. Shame!Aug 31, 2018"

Coopers Sparkling Ale,3.25,3.25,4.25,3.5,"OK so it bottle fermented so has a sediment but in my humble opinion disregard the label advise that is can be drunk with or without the sediment. Unlike a Weissbier the sediment can be a bit gritty and should be avoided. Pour it slowly and AVOID the sediment in the bottom of the bottle. Then it’s a great brew. Serve cold IMO it goes down well, smells like a lager should, subtle but more beer than bubbles. Taste is good and the slight after taste is good to. Definitely enough to have you reaching for the next one or six.Feb 15, 2021"
Coopers Sparkling Ale,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.75,"Nice lively pour from the bottle, activated head that dissipates champagne-like to a thin ring, no retention. Dark orange, light brown, moderate haziness. Nose is brown bread, roasted malts, lemon/hay, not much in the way of hops. Palate is light and pleasant, slight malt sweetness, back note of bitterness on the finish. Carbonation is stellar - sharp and crisp, everything I'd want from a sessionable beer. An extremely welcome surprise.Nov 29, 2020"

Coopers Sparkling Ale,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Caution: It's Bottle Conditioned!
L- ... which I wasn't expecting from an Australian beer! So poured with a 3mm white head, finishing with a couple of drops of sediment on top. It now resembles a Long Island Iced Tea, but that's my oversight. The lable (I read now) states you can enjoy it poured clear or hazy, the latter akin to a German Hefeweissen.
S- Quite lively, fresh, almost notes of apple.
T- Bright, slightly piquant, into a mildly malty middle and lightly hopped finish.
F- I'm serving this chilled and it's refreshing = ^Bright+piquant+hopping. It feels lighter than 5.8% especially if well chilled. I'd have guessed about 4.8%, though as it warms a touch I'm beginning to register it more.
O- Interesting beer, and it is something a bit different. I'd suggest not chilling it too hard or you'll risk lessening the flavour. I'm glad to have reviewed it, but there is not enough of note here to warrant buying it again.

Coopers Sparkling Ale,4.0,4.25,4.0,4.25,"Good to know that there is more in Aussland than VBs and Fosters (of course there must be loads, I just haven't had any yet...)
Now this one looks nice and smells/tastes quite interesting for an English Pale Ale like others said - has a sort of floweriness in there, maybe some slight candied fruitiness too that I can't decipher well. Unlike the American ones, this English PA is more dominated by the bitterness that in this case is well balanced the malt base.
I was looking for the spark but I found it when pouring the whole bottle along with the sediment out in the glass - that made it fizzy with carbonation even more! With this extra, it became even better than in the beginning. Recommend pouring all of it out at once!
Quite alright, made me interested in Aussie craft even more!Feb 23, 2019"
Coopers Sparkling Ale,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.25,"75ml bottle

Cloudy orange, lots of sediment and particles floating. Small head dissapears quickly livig a white film on top and medium carbonation.

Smells weird for a Pale Ale. A lot lemony/lime -7up/sprite alike-, some yeast that reminds the belgian, and a sweet malty/caramel background.

Taste follows the nose, caramel is more obvious in this one than in the Original Pale Ale. Lemon/lime notes and some 'belgian' alike yeast.

Mouthfeel is somewhat odd. Crisp carbonation and a bit of a spicy finish.

Good to try it, but wouldn't choose it over other Pale Ales.Nov 18, 2018"

Coopers Sparkling Ale,4.0,4.25,4.25,4.5,"Decanted from a 12.7 oz (376 ml) into a conical pint glass; best after July 16, 2017.
A: Pours a hazy, golden-brown color with a one half inch off white head, little retention or lacing. Of note, small yeast particles abound and an almost Brownian motion is evident due to their interaction with the strong effervescence.
S: Floral. Aromas of honeysuckle, caramel, citrus, and cocoa are most evident. Maybe a little grassy.
T: Semisweet. Flavors of caramel, sweet bread, melon, and citrus (orange) were most striking. Just enough light bitterness to give it a crisp, clean finish despite the sweetness.
M: Light bodied with a very strong effervescence. Playful on the palate like a well made sparkling wine.
O: This was an unusual and very enjoyable Pale Ale. The light body, low bitterness, and full, playful carbonation combined for a really refreshing treat. Would absolutely have this again; a great find for summer.Apr 24, 2018"
Coopers Sparkling Ale,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Poured into a Samuel Smith pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a thin white head that dissipates to tiny patches, slight lacing. Aroma of semi-sweet biscuit malt, light lemon citrus and light grassy hops. Flavor is deep biscuit malt, hints of citrus and moderate grassy hops with a slightly astringent hop bitterness in the finish, but nice residual malt. Medium bodied with sharp carbonation, despite the lack of a persistant head. Nice malt depth and appropriate grassy hops for the style, but the hops are somewhat harsh and leave an odd stale bitterness in the finish. The malt rescues this from the hops, and this would be a robust choice for a hot Australian afternoon and more interesting than bland lagers. OK, but not inspiring. After reviewing this, I glanced through the other reviews and was struck by the odd fact that reviewers alternately give the color as medium orange (close to the medium copper I gave it) or else pale yellow or straw. That's just weird. At least one ""pale straw"" review mentions ""sparkling"" which seems to indicate it's the right beer. Could there be that much color variation or an high rate of misidentification while reviewing? Strange.Feb 04, 2018"
Coopers Sparkling Ale,4.25,3.0,4.25,4.5,"Drunk cool from the fridge, this beer combines a good balance of bitterness and bubbles to make it an outstanding feature beer suited to South Australia's hot dry summer climate.

Coopers Sparkling Ale,3.0,3.5,3.75,3.25,"This is a strange one. Well carbonated ultra-pale straw color with a one finger head that doesn't leave lacing. Nose is earth hops, mineral water, and pale malt. Taste is a unique combo of pale malt, english hops, a barely noticeable esther, and something oddly mineral-infused. Light body and medium carbonation.
It fits the definition of an ""Australian Sparkling Lager"" to a T. There's a lot going on, including some things that no other beer does. The mineral note is still throwing me through a loop.Dec 08, 2017"

This beer pours pale yellow and topped with several inches of off white head that is fed by a constant flow of bubbles from nucleation points etched in the bottom of the glass. It leaves nice lacing rings as I consume it.

It has a sweet grain and malt aroma. I get a little earthy barnyard grass. 

The taste matches the smell. Sweet and malty upfront. Grassy on the back end.

Light but not watery body.

Moosehead Lager,4.5,3.25,3.25,3.0,"Moosehead Lager is crstal clear and a pale gold in color. Like straw, only a little lighter. The head is cloudy, bone white, and has decent retention.

At first blush, Moosehead smells like pretty much any half decent lager. it has an up front sweetness to it, supported by the bready, grainy, soda cracker aromas of pale malt. The center is only slightly rounded with notes of sulfur. Buried in with the sulfur is a sweetness that does smell somewhat of corn. That aroma of corn is subtle enough that I could be imagining it as corn thanks to the adjacent presence of sulfur. The finish is lightly hoppy, smelling appropriately of fresh cut grass.

On the tongue, Moosehead feels a little more mainstream in nature. For one thing, it starts off light in body and fairly dry in nature. Pale malts are a little more dominant in the form of graininess coupled with soda crackers. Roundness builds slightly but not quite enough to give any real refreshing quality to the lager. Rather, notes of sulfur come through, only helping to lend support to Moosehead's overall dryness. 

Moosehead Lager isn't terrible by any means. It's just not as good as it could be. The problem with lagers is when faults creep their way into your beer there's no place for them to hide. So when this one doesn't quite round itself off enough, the lager doesn't become as refreshing as it otherwise might be.May 11, 2021"

Coedo Kyara,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,"In summary, a hopped up lager. Poured from its 333 ml stubby bottle, the appearance of this brew is a clear golden-orange, topped with a good head of white froth. Aromas are a mix between an IPA and a lager - hoppy floral and fruity notes, with a distinct lager like bready malt aroma. Taste is similar, opening with the citrus fruit notes, followed by some malty sweetness, and then ending with a lager crispness with some light bitterness. Mouthfeel is light, but with carbonation bite, clean and crisp. Interesting hybrid of styles!Jun 22, 2017"

Coedo Kyara,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Packaged on: 4/10/15.

Pours a clear golden-orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Thin streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, candied citrus zest, floral, and spicy hop aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest, tea, grape juice, and earthy hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a nice mix of different hop qualities all around.

Coedo Kyara,3.5,4.0,3.75,3.75,"Appearance - first beer that I have had that had sediment, this was slightly off putting, pours Amber golden, with very small head, some lacing. Aroma - smells very fresh, earth has some nose of honey. Taste - tastes almost like a whiskey, I feel that the taste is more alcoholly than the 5.5% abv demands. Feel - astringent, neither warm or cool aftertaste. Overall - appearance is slightly off putting, not sure if this is due to me not understanding sediment / appreciating it, also beer is 2 days prior it's expiration date, so not sure if this has impacted on taste / aroma qualities. Reminds me of a whiskey, not bad would be keen to explore ire of what the brewer has to offer.Jun 10, 2015"

Coedo Kyara,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,"Saw a bottles of this beer along with it's darker cousin at my local beer shop, decided to see what Japanese craft beer was like.

I have to wonder whether I received a bad bottle. 

There was no head whatsoever after carefully pouring it into my glass. The colour was a clear rich amber, not bad, but it seemed as if there was little carbonation. I'm not a huge fan of highly carbonated beers however this beer seemed to have less than average for a craft beer.

The taste was extremely malty. So much so, that I couldn't finish it. Just too much malt for my liking. It tastes EXACTLY like a Tsingtao Dark.

If there was nothing wrong with my bottle, and they're all like this, I would recommend going for Tsingtao Dark because it tastes exactly the same at about 1/5 the price.Oct 29, 2011"
Coedo Kyara,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,"A-Very light amber with a thin ring of fat white soapy bubbles.

S-Nondescript malty sweetness. Not much to say about it.

T/M-It's okay. Vienna lagers aren't the most distinctive style, so it's kind of hard to say much about this one. Pale malt sweetness, light, spritzy carbonation. An easy sipper without many distinguishing characteristics. I couldn't pick it out of a line-up.

O-Fine for the style, which admittedly is not one of my favorites.Aug 11, 2011"

Overall, an easy drinking beer. Sessionable.Apr 23, 2011"
Coedo Kyara,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,"Poured on-tap into a tumbler pint at Azuki, a sushi joint in San Diego. They were advertising this on the menu as being new to the establishment, so I figured I'd give it a try. The beer pours a hazy, bright yellow coloring with no head. Lots of bubbling throughout the beer. Very light toasty smells, which are expected for the style. Mid-tongue sour flavors are slight with the maltiness, and the beer is a bit sharp due to the lightness and the increased carbonation. Musty sour aftertaste with a slight linger on the finish. Does not impart itself over any of the food flavorings, so I will venture to guess it would pair well with just about anything. I had a couple of fairly spicy handrolls, and it went great with all my food.Apr 11, 2011"
Coedo Kyara,4.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,"Purchased from the Nijiya in SF.

Pours copper with minimal white head. Smells of caramel and malts. Tastes like watered down liquid malt extract- that is to say a bit sweet, though not badly balanced with hops. Flavor doesn't linger, which makes it easy drinking. 

Unfortunately, given the price, it definitely is not a session beer- I'll choose Echigo stout as my goto japanese malty beer.Nov 13, 2010"
Coedo Kyara,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.5,"Poured from 333mL bottle into a pint glass.

Appearance: medium gold hue with some haze and a lot of super tiny floaties. Head was nearly nonexistent upon pouring. Color is quite good, but really? No head at all? I just can't abide that.

Smell: rich, somewhat sweet, genuine malt aroma. There is a slight touch of noble/earthy hop aroma, but it is almost an afterthought compared to the malt. It's actually quite good.

Taste: hops are more prominent and nicely complex here. The overall balance with the very basic-but-good malt flavors is quite pleasing. Good stuff!

Mouthfeel: medium body; denser than most lagers. Carbonation, however, is extremely low; this beer feels almost flat. Not my favorite by a long shot, although the good body mitigates this somewhat.

Drinkability: Coedo Kyara is all over the map for me. Aroma and flavor are truly quite good, but the lack of carbonation greatly detriments the look and feel of this beer, which should be a nicely carbonated style. Still, the flavor is good enough that I won't hit it too hard because of the carb factor.Jul 31, 2010"
Coedo Kyara,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,"True to its (somewhat pretentious and archaic) name, this beer is a pleasing translucent golden color. The head is white and consists of many small, delicate bubbles. It dissipates rather quickly but does leave some nice lacing. 

Sweet floral aromas are present, as well as some cream and fruit notes. There's a bit of a piercing resin smell initially but it quickly fades. I was also able to detect a muted raspberry aroma. Apple, peach, and honey flavors come together to make a really smooth taste reminiscent of cider. For a lager with only average alcohol content, this beer is surprisingly full-bodied. The rich, creamy mouthfeel complements the sweet taste well, and every sip has a nice warming effect.

This is a solid offering from Coedo that's easy to drink, but the taste is a bit too simple to really get fired up about. Dry lagers are quite the rage in Japan so it's nice to have a sweet one like this for a change. While I wouldn't mind having it again, I don't think I'd go out of my way to find it.Jun 23, 2010"
Coedo Kyara,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,"Clear, bright Orange with a nice white head; 

Nose of stone fruit and malt with light nose of creamed sweet coffee;

Oettinger Pils,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,"0 ml can, bought in Spain. ABV is 4.7%. Crystal clear pale yellow colour, big to moderate white head. Sweetish aroma, notes of candy, some floral and grassy notes too.

Oettinger Pils,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,"This is a very clean beer that comes at an exceptionally low price point. It's dry and has a fair amount of bittering hops, but not much in the way of noble hops aroma.

At 4.7% ABV it is at the top end for a session beer. My take on Pilseners is that they are supposed to be 'light' on flavour, but personally I would want more Saaz or other noble hops on the nose than is the case here. My guess is that the bittering hops, of unknown provenance, are there to fill the gap created by highly attenuated fermentation and lack of floral, spicey or earthy hops aromas.

Does the trick as a summer drink or as a palate cleanser with spicy food.

This is not an adjunct lager as other reviews seem to suggest.Jan 22, 2021"

However, now in Japan after some months of celibacy without a decent beer I immediately reached out for this in Yamaya, God knows why but I did. And I backed it down as if it was the best thing on Earth (almost) after the poor or at best mediocre Japanese beers...
Well, this beer is also far from being perfect but at least it was a proper beer and at least it was not bad, was not skunked, had a slight metallic aftertaste... BUT it was a proper beer. Fantastic for the moment, acceptable for the beer, will not seek it out again though.Mar 02, 2019"
Oettinger Pils,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,"A refreshing everyday beer, apparently Germany's most popular due to the low price yet consistently decent quality. Bright light gold colour, quick fizz of champagne carbonation on pouring with a keen but brief head, pleasantly sweet bread nose with a faint citrus note. Taste is an agreeable blend of slightly sweet malt, mushrooms, gentle hops and mild orange peel. Tangy dry finish. This is a mild-tasting beer for guzzling in hot weather but will be acceptable in most settings that call for a well-balanced pale lager that most people will enjoy, at a very sensible price.Jan 09, 2019"
Oettinger Pils,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,"Pours a clear straw yellow color, visible carbonation and a dense bubbly head. The head dissipates rather quickly, however, a layer of film retains throughout.
Aromas of toasted and biscuity grains throughout, with a light touch of citrus.
The taste is predominantly sweet and malt forward. Very little bitterness with a light touch of lemon and gentle hops spice. 
Light and rather smooth for the style. Carbonation is gentle for the style. The less than assertive bitterness also goes against the style.
Perhaps not the truest to style as it is perhaps closer to Munich Helles or even Bohemian Pilsner, however, it is tasty, refreshing and deserving of higher scores than shown here.Jul 11, 2018"
Oettinger Pils,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,"Poured from just under fridge temp. Pours a transparent yellow with quickly dissipating white head. Nose is citrus peel, lemon, wheat, bread, and nuts.

Oettinger Pils,4.5,4.25,5.0,5.0,"I found this beer when I was looking for a beer to call my favourite. It had to be German (I've always liked German beer) and not too pricey or taste too strange. This has fitted the bill PERFECTLY. Another great bonus is that it actually is the cheapest beer you can get in Australia. But dont let that fool you as it nearly did, me. This is high quality pure german beer that really deserves its place in every tap in every pub in the world. Light, balanced and proper beer with a clear yet bitter taste. Thanks to the German purity law which this abides by, I also get to enjoy a most surprising yet pleasant side effect. 0 hangover! Took me off guard but happy to have that. If red wine gives the worst hangovers due to lots of impurities, this beer is on the opposite end of the spectrum. I've had it in a can and bottle. Go with bottle as it gives it that edge in terms of taste and feel. Overall, im glad that this new favourite beer of mine is German, bloody good, causes no hangover and just so happens to be the easiest on my wallet. That lets me drink it even more guilt free!

Oettinger Pils,4.0,2.5,3.25,3.5,"Single 330mL can obtained from the Auto Mercado supermarket in Tamarindo, Costa Rica for 655 CR colones (~ US $1.24). Code ""19.01.2017 B3 P10 19:17"" printed on the bottom of the can. 

A gentle pour generates a whopping 3 fingers of frothy bleach white foam which slowly condenses in a minute or two to a few small wispy patches and a thin meniscus around the glass. Rigorous carbonation clinging to the glass and flowing upward shows no signs of slowing down. Crystal clear light yellow brew. Smell is sweet thin pilsener malt, a small dose of noble hops, and a significant note of aluminum (bleh). Taste is pretty thin and bland, not much malt to speak of and just enough generic herbal hop to leave an impression in the finish. Aluminum note also present but not as strong as in the smell. Body is thin, crisp, and the carbonation not as aggressive as it looks. A decent, watery, cheap, chuggable brew for a hot day. Not terrible, but not memorable either.Feb 27, 2016"

Oettinger Pils,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,"Format: standard 330mL light brown bottle with a pretty boring macro lager.

Appearance: pours out a fairly light yellow amber colour with over a finger of fluffing white head that fritters away to a thin film. Looks okay.

Aroma: some sweet grains here with a touch of grass hops. Quite a light aroma.

Taste: there is a bit of a malt fug here alongside the grains and touch of grass. A bit awkward, but better than I expected considering the price.

Aftertaste: the flavours drop away pretty quickly with only that odd malt flavour lasting through. Still, not bad.

Mouth feel: a light feel with a medium to stronger carbonation. A touch dry on the finish, definitely a refreshing pilsener.

Overall: this is a pretty cheap macro-lageresque version of the German pilsener. It is drinkable and very refreshing, but nothing really special. Where this beer wins out is the almost amazing price of AU$31 for a case of 24 x 330mL. It blows my mind that this can be sent over from Germany for this price, and yet the standard Australian 'cheap' macro lagers tend to be around $45 - or almost 50% more. What the??Dec 16, 2014"
Oettinger Pils,2.5,2.5,2.75,2.75,"This is probably one of the best value-for-money drinking beers you can get in Australia. It's nothing special as far as pilseners go, but at $15 for a six pack of 500ml cans, you really can't go far wrong. Quite watery with high carbonation and a medium, tolerably metallic hoppy bitterness. Would recommend to anyone who wants to get pissed fast and cheap but not resort to VB or XXXX Bitters.Jul 12, 2014"
Oettinger Pils,3.5,2.5,3.0,2.75,"For the money its a really good drop. $15 a 6 pack here in Australia and comes in a great 500ml can. On that front it smashed most other macro beers off the shelf.

In terms of quality its ok. Certainly brewed on a budget but there is some malt complexity in there. A touch of depth in the malt profile brings forth a late sweetness which I find good and also necessary as the hops are sharp and very grassy. A little poor quality and probably not the best saaz going around but all for the price its pretty good.

Quite a soft carbonation and almost creamy mouthfeel late in the piece. Carbonation feels a bit fine for a pilsner but not unsatisfying.May 02, 2014"

Look: clear pale amber body with a large, semi-durable white head. Some foamy lacing. 

A very interesting ale. A strong Belgian influence was immediately evident: there's a yeasty, spicy fruity flavor and aroma. The flavor is both bitter and tart. Reading the fine print on the label I see that this is in fact brewed in Belgium, although ""designed"" in Tokyo.

Poured a nice cloudy deep yellow with a good creamy tight to medium head that disappeared quite quickly. Not much lacing.

Expressive nose - lots of citrus including orange with notes of banana and clove. Some yeast spice.

The palate is heavy and full-bodied with citrus and spice with a strong clove presence. Not much malt or hops. I found it a little cloying. Well-rounded nonetheless with flavours coming through all over the mouth. Long spicy finish.

Mouth feel is full with low, tight carbonation. Nice

Overall an interesting and enjoyable beer. Will appeal to Belgian blonde and wheatbeer style drinkers but others may find it too heavy. Good for one or two - not a session beer. 

Kagua seems to be stuck somewhere between styles. Not quite a wheat and not quite a Belgian ale. It's flavoured with yuzu, sansho and other spices as well.

Kagua Blanc,4.0,3.5,3.75,3.5,"A: The beer is hazy pale yellow in color and has a light amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a finger high white head that died down, leaving a short head covering the surface and lots of lacing down the sides of the glass. 
S: Light aromas of lemon peels are present in the nose along with notes of Belgian yeast. 
T: The taste follows the smell, having flavors of lemon peels along with notes of Belgian yeast and spices. 
M: It feels medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation. No dryness is perceptible. 
O: This beer seems like a hybrid between a witbier (from the citrus peel) and a Belgian Pale Ale. The refreshing nature of the citrus could make for this being a nice beer for a day in the late spring or early fall.

Rogue Dead Guy Ale,3.5,4.0,3.75,4.0,"This is an interesting Octoberfest type beer. Smell is of spices and orange peel. Has a full bodied feel. Taste is a bit all over the place. I don't know if this beer wants to be a marzen or a pale ale. You get a bit of honey along with a nice Bock hop taste. Some citrus with coriander. Interesting beer and can't say I've had one quite like this.Oct 09, 2021"
Rogue Dead Guy Ale,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,"Dark amber small white head, not much retention. Way to dark for the style. 
Smells of caramel, brown bread, for the most part it smells good. 
Tastes initially sweet but a huge hit of bittering hops hits you straight away. The hops completely drown out the malts. A Maibock should be malt forward with the hops way in the background. I can’t say this is a bad beer it’s just not anything like a maibock.Oct 08, 2021"
Rogue Dead Guy Ale,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,"From a 12 oz can dated 6/18/21 -- exactly 3 months ago. Purchased at MV Wine & Spirits, Martha's Vineyard.
Poured into an ordinary tumbler. 

I normally only drink IPAs but decided to give this a shot since this store has increasingly tended to stop stocking my favorite IPAs, which also happen to be inexpensive (Jai Alai, Zombie Dust, Racer 5, etc), and replaced them with beers that go for $21 for a 4-pack. This Dead Guy Ale was something like $12.50 for a sixpack.

Dark amber color, very little head. Smells malty. Actually to this IPA drinker, it smells very, very malty. And sweet. Not much lacing, although I admit that I've never understood why that matters & never pay attention to it. (Full disclosure: the tumbler I'm drinking it from is made of plastic. The horror! The horror!)

The taste is, at first, very malty, like a porter or a stout. But it then yields some complexity, with some of the typical hoppy flavors (grapefruit, pine, etc) asserting themselves. There is a definite temporal aspect. The taste changes over a second or two, as it does in all beers worth drinking. 

The mouthfeel is towards the thick, stout side, but it's not as viscous those porters that make you feel like you're drinking a malted milk shake. It's quite pleasant. It's pretty much what I consider perfect texture for a beer, something missing in many IPAs — even the good ones. Carbonation is also at the goldilocks point; not too bubbly, not too flat.

Overall I'd say it's very good. I'm enjoying it. But I don't expect it to buy it again anytime soon because I'm really not a big fan of malty beers. If you like porters & stouts & maibocks, you should read reviews of Dead Guy Ale written by people who like those kinds of beers. They're sure to be more helpful than this one.Sep 18, 2021"
Rogue Dead Guy Ale,4.0,4.0,4.75,3.0,"aight so,

just poured this mf up rn. shit looks like an amber ale idk it's cool.
light smell, kinda caramel-ish and toasted which reflex's the taste.
this bitch is toasty but not TOO toasty, you feel me? Got some nutty flavor in there and caramel/bread
SUPER CRISP, def try this one while your sick with Havana syndrome on a hot day/cool fall evening
mouth feel is medium bodied but v pleasant 

overall pretty pleasantly surprised, i thought this was gonna be an unbearable hoppy IPA type (i know it's not an IPA) but i would gdef buy this again.

cheers fellas!Sep 15, 2021"
Rogue Dead Guy Ale,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Poured into a tall clear pint glass. Has a dark brown/amberish color with more than a finger's worth of creamy head. Good retention and lacing.

Aroma: caramel, toffee, brown/burnt sugar, toasted malts and nuts, vanilla, apples, yeast, and brown bread.

Tastes almost kinda sweet, while also being bready and nutty too more so. Notes from the aroma altogether make this beer. Body is medium-light.Sep 14, 2021"
Rogue Dead Guy Ale,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"L: First the can. It's difficult to make him look good on a cooler display. I noticed that the brewery was founded in 1988. It's caramel brown on the pour and moderately active. The bubbles are small and prickly and it's filmy/glossy too.

S: Caramel malty notes with a light brushing of hops.

T: It's almost sweet but pulled back from the brink with a mild IBU rating. (25? 30?). I'm relieved by the lack of nuttiness. Again, it's very malty. There are 5 grains to 1 hop. 

F: Heavy, but it has to be to contain all this goodness. It's smooth on the palate, and I wouldn't guess that it was 6.8%. 

O: Given the age of the brewery and the ubiquitous-ness of the Rogue™ brand, tracking down the Dead Guy is an easy task. Ask a beer to stock it for you, prepay for your case even. You might not find him on the shelves, but trust me, he is at a warehouse nearby.Jul 05, 2021"
Rogue Dead Guy Ale,4.0,4.5,3.5,4.0,"Pours a very pretty translucent copper with a very small tan head. It smells like toasty malts with a decent amount of banana yeast smell to it.

Rogue Dead Guy Ale,4.0,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Appearance: Pours a beautiful clear, dark orange to amber color with a strong head. Not pale at all surprisingly. (4.00)

Aroma: : Strong and malty aromas of rich caramel, toffee, sweet brown brea, brown sugar, syrup, and rich brown malts. Some definite and rich floral and hints of amber citrus notes. Maybe some vanilla cream. underneath. (4.25)

Flavor: The flavors follows with strong an deep brown bread flavors of caramel, toffeee, brown sugar, syrup , and rich and sweet brown bread malts. There's pasry, strudel with a sweet nutty pecan and walnut flavor. Somewhat of a floral and amber citrus note as well. There is a mild hop flavor of amber citrus and maybe apricot? Sweet, yet an appropriately dry, smooth and balanced finish. Hides the alcohol well.

Mouthfeel: A full bodied mouthfeel. Not oily, but heavy enough and with respectable carbonation. Leans sweet, but smooth and drinkable

Compared to Schells' Bock 5/29/21: Pours a lighter and more orange color. Stronger aromas/flavors. More caramel, toffee, sweet bread, amber citrus, and apricot. Less brown bread crumbs, toast, and syrup flavor. Winner: Dead Guy

Overall: This is a delicious beer one of the few I've had from the Maibock style It has an intense and rich caramel flavor. Nice toffee, nuts, and floral and hoppy amber citrus & apricot flavor to support. Less toasted or roasted flavors like other German beers, as expected of the Maibock style. Has a decent body and a background sweetness that is not too overbearing. Quite a well balanced brew and incredibly drinkable for a malty beer. (Final Rating: 4.34)May 30, 2021"

22oz bottle served in a snulip. I can't find a date on it, which surprises me.

Pours a rich honey-amber, just slightly hazy, with a medium sized head that collapses to little more than a ring with a very thin island. Don't see much in the way of carbonation. Smell is tea, nuts, bread/yeast, maybe a very light toffee.

Taste is a little nutty, a little sweet, a bit more on the roasty/toasty side of the bread, a little bit of tea flavor. I get an earthy kind of bitterness out of it, which is pretty nice.

Mouthfeel is light, clean, but a bit still. Overall, very nice beer. And more than a little surprised that I haven't reviewed it until now.Apr 22, 2021"

A: Pours copper amber with a frothy khaki head that settles to a light layer and laces nicely.

S: Fruity, spicy, bready, toasty, yeasty, slight floral and herbal notes, a hint of oak, and a little toffee and burnt sugar. 

T: Fruity esters up front, apple, pear, apricot, orange blossom, and banana, big toasty bready malt, some spice, slight floral and herbal notes, dare I say a bit of oak, and a little toffee sweetness. 

M: On the fuller side of medium body, moderate carbonation. 

O: After all these years of saying ""I'll snag that one next time..."" I finally did! Let me just say that maibocks are not a style I'm all that familiar with so I can't really judge it to style. As a beer in front of me, it hits that malty craving for a cool spring day, but has enough of a hop presence to taste just as good on a warm spring day.Feb 13, 2021"

Aroma: Warm brown bread, melanoidin, caramel, some fruity esters, and earthy hops

Mouthfeel: Full, clean throughout, medium-high carbonation, and fairly soft on the finish
Overall: I dig it. This is probably the beer that put these folks on the map for a lot of people and though not ‘true-to-style’ as a Maibock (starting with the fact they call it an ale), it’s solid and well-made enough to thoroughly enjoy.

Pale golden, bright and clear, very clean looking: on top a large white foaming head.

A hop bite to the initial taste, some hop esters in the smell, grains also. Better than a lot of the 'mainstream' German lager/pilsners in both aroma and taste. Once into it you realise It is sweeter than a lot of the well known German beers in this style, which is maybe why I've enjoyed it so (my sweet tooth coming through again).

Poured into a tulip pint glass. A clear golden hue with medium carbonation. Yields a large head of creamy white foam that lasts for a couple of minutes before subsiding. Aroma of grassy, spicy hops with hints of light malt, pepper and faint fruitiness. More depth than the average macro lager.

Tastes of light malt and leafy hops, with a crisp bitter finish. Notes of grass/hay, subtle spice, mild grain, earthy yeast, a faint fruitiness and a hint of stewed hops. Dry, followed by a piquant bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth and tingly, with peppery hop oils stimulating the palate. Good body for the style, but a shade undercarbonated. Mildly astringent, accompanied by an aftertaste of leafy, grassy hops, yeast esters and faint malt.

Rather nice - a tasty German pils and probably the best bottled version I've encountered over here. Looks good, while the aroma and flavour have a delicate hop character that suits the style perfectly. Decent body; could be more effervescent. The dry-hopping has a discernible impact on the flavour.

T - Starts off with the strong pils malt bite. Turns to a more bitter and balanced flavor through the addition of some yeast breadiness. Some of the bitterness becomes overbearing at times. Strong retained pils aftertaste.

M- Light to moderate body. Beer is light, but the carbonation brings it back. Clean finish.

Golden yellow, lots of carbonation, and a full, frothy head; everything looks normal except the head, which is much healthier looking than I'm used to; (canned Sept. '07, so this is more than a year old beer); some healthy lacing left

Smell
A bit grainy, but not a whole lot of aroma; after it warms, aroma becomes bigger with bread notes appearing

Taste & Mouthfeel
First thing that strikes me are the hops--I can actually taste them! That's especially remarkable considering this is a year old (making me a believe out of cans). In addition to the hop bitters, there's some other bitters either coming from either the mineral content in the water or the yeast; it tastes somewhat sulfury, but not over-the-top or bad like say Heineken; body is light and smooth, with a slightly oily texture; malts become noticeable after it warms

500ml can

clear, light golden straw color. decent head soon fades to scarce wisps and a thin ring. lacing is very nice however.

aroma is a bit faint, but you can pick out some noble hops, a subtle maltiness, and maybe bread or yeast.

palate brings a little more flavor. a decent mix of noble hop spiciness and bitterness, with a surprising amount of malt presence, esp. given the light color and muted aroma of the beer. in the end, the bitterness is pretty dry and does have a slight dominating effect on the other flavors. maybe a trace of overcooked veggie or DMS? well, it's just borderline, so not really noticeable unless you overthink it...

feel is ever so slightly watery, but smooth. the carbonation is very prickly, almost overdone, but acceptable, and depending on the mood, can be refreshing, i think.

Pale gold and brilliant white big head, dry crisp slightly nutty aroma, typical for the style. Has a dryish crisp taste as expected from the type, some bitterness of the hops in the finish, only very little sweetness or malts in the overall favours. Was very carbonated in the pour, which may have added to the dry finish and aroma. I enjoyed this, thought it refreshing, though I would not class it as one of the best pilsner beers, but worth having on tap when in Nuremberg, both at the Tucher bar and in the many outlets thoughout the city.

Tucher Pilsener,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,"Sun-washed gold topped by a large cotton white head that displays multitudinous bubbles standing shoulder to shoulder on its upper surface. There's enough sticky lace adhering to the glass to keep visual interest from flagging... although not enough to truly impress. A good pilsener look; clean and pure.

The nose is noble hops from stem to stern. You were expecting something different from a German pilsener? I don't speak German, but it was easy to tell from the website that Hallertau is in use. Spicy aromas are as evident as grassy ones, maybe more so. This isn't a nose that wows me even though there's nothing really wrong with it.

Tucher Pilsener is a good beer that, for better or for worse, pays as much attention to its malt as to its hops. For better, I believe. There's a hefty quantity of sweetish malt (considering the style) that adds another dimension to what can sometimes be a one-dimensional style. Hop flavor and bitterness are clearly the focal points, although their support is never very far away from the action.

The usual noble flavors apply, with bitter lemon making more of an impact on the palate than expected. This beer tastes like the beer equivalent of those salads that one is often served in trendy restaurants. The ones with spiky, weedy looking, bitter greens that have been tossed in lemon-balsamic vinaigrette (minus the balsamic vinegar in this case). I happen to like those salads and I like this beer too.

The body/mouthfeel is closer to medium than to light and is decently creamy in the bargain. The restrained amount of carbonation helps, but I can't help feeling that the (slightly) greater than usual amount of malt is the biggest contributor to what is a very nice mouth presence. The bitter-sweet balance, the lemony flavor, the light creaminess... it all adds to up to a drinkable (nay, sessionable) pilsener.

I've been pleased with each of the three Brauerei Tucher Brau beers that I've had prior to this one. All have been some variety of weizen and all have been delicious. Tucher Pilsener isn't the best version of its style that I've ever run across, but it disappeared with ease and I find myself wishing I had another bottle. This one deserves a look.Mar 09, 2006"

Original review of 13OCT02: The last bier on my German excursion. Enjoyed despite the onset of some food poisoning.... A rich, golden color, with a fine, bright-white head sitting atop it. The head opted to hang a bit, but left minimal lace. Had a strong, grassy hop nose....real potent. Body was in the medium range, but a smidge too prickly on the tongue for me. Minimal malt, as expected, with lots of strong, bittering hops attacking the palate...they aren't shy at all. Good, for a pils (though not my fave style)... and for #350. Prosit!!

Poured a standard clear pale gold under a 1/2 finger white head that faded very quickly; shamefully quickly for a pilsener. The nose is mild and flowery.. The mouth has medium carbonation but is fairly heavy, almost syrupy. The taste opens with subdued malt, followed by a tinny metallic hops finish. There is some bitterness in the aftertaste, but this is a poor excuse for a pilsener.Feb 15, 2004"
Tucher Pilsener,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,"Typically average german brew with a nice all around malt and aromatic hop nose. Pale and bubbly, fine head. Malt dominates, firm bodied with an ok (but not great) bitter finish. Seems to be bit of a mix between a typical bavarian helles and a bohemian pils.Jul 14, 2003"
Tucher Pilsener,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,"Probably the most widely available beer in Nuremburg. Classic german pilsner - light, straw golden color, dense white head and extremely refreshing. Hop flavor is very dominant. This pils pairs extremely well with the beechwood grilled Nurnberger brats sold all over the city. Next time you are in Nuremberg be sure to visit one of the many snack stands (called Imbiss) located throughout the city and order ""drei brats mit brotchen und ein Tucher Pils"" for lunch. You won't regret it! If you would like to try this same experience in a ""sit down"" atmosphere, visit the famous Bratwursthausle which has been in operation since the 1500's.

Queen's Ale Blonde Type,3.0,3.0,3.25,3.25,"Nice to have a decent Korean beer. An amber beer with minimal head that is nonetheless lively. The aroma hints at a little bit of toffee and some flowers. When tasted it is a little sweet but the hops do come through, although more could be pushed through. Not the most refined finished but a reasonable job.Jan 08, 2016"
Queen's Ale Blonde Type,4.5,3.25,3.5,4.25,"Ok so let me explain this rating. First you need to understand Korean beer. The big three here are Cass, Hite, and OB. All of them are skunky nasty lagers. There is also an obsession with lagers here. Sweet German and Belgian Beers are all the rage. You can get hoppier beers but they are usually imports and bloody expensive. So this ""Blond Type"" really threw me off at first. I expected a blond ale. I did not get one. I got something better. While I still prefer the extra bitter version of this ale, I have to say this is one of the the only really solid beer I've found that's made in Korea outside of the adjunct lager type. The color is a brilliant amber, the smell is pretty good floral with nice bitter undertones, the taste is a bit confusing at first but really is somewhere between an American IPA and a blonde ale. I'm not sure that British Pale Ale really does it justice, but ok sure I could see it fitting that taste profile. The mouth feel is great actually. I expect Korean beers to be sticky and slightly nasty (sorry I've lived here for the last year, good beer has been largely lacking) This drinks a bit bitter, smooth, no alcohol overtones, not sticky. A great great summer beer. Especially when served at about 40 degrees which is where I prefer most of my summer beers. So this actually would be rated higher if people knew what they were getting when they bought it. I pay about 3,500 won for a 16 oz can here (about 3.46) if they brought this to the USA at a similar price point I would be hesitant. Beer here is much more expensive than in the US. But if they licensed it so I could get it closer to 2 dollars a can in the US? I would drink it often.Jul 01, 2014"
Queen's Ale Blonde Type,4.0,3.75,3.5,2.5,"Pours a finger of head on a clear medium straw colored body.
The aroma has a nice tropical fruitiness to it: mango and pineapple mostly. 
The taste is on the lighter side. Mild lemon candy bitterness and some pine. A descent balance.
The texture is fizzy, which takes away from the otherwise nice profile.
Not bad if you're looking for a light but flavorful beer.Feb 19, 2014"
Queen's Ale Blonde Type,3.75,4.0,2.5,2.75,"A: Clear but dull light amber colour. Big foamy head.

S: Fruity hops and fudge. Burned caramel. Ooer, nice-uh!

T: CARDBOARD, and lots of. The bittering hops are well off the mark. There's a lot of pleasant banana–like/solvent/nail varnish, but in a 5.4% beer?!!! It is citrusy and there are hints of woodiness but the flavours simply don't work in harmony.

O: Young South Koreans are getting fed up with their domestic piss and are willing to pay more for imports. This is HiteJinro's response to that growing demand - a faux craft beer - and it's not going to cut it.Oct 01, 2013"
Stephans Brau Hefeweizen,3.25,3.75,3.5,3.0,"Looks a bit thin, not very cloudy like most Hefeweizens. Two-fingered head receded quickly and left a thin ring for the session. Smells like a Paulaner- slightly fruity and delicious. Taste is very bready and mild. Mouthfeel is on the light side for a hefe. Not quite watery...but very quaffable. Overall I’d have this again because it’s just so darn cheap- 8 cans for 10,000 Korean Won ($8.50). There are much (MUCH) better representations of the style, but I’ve had worse Hefeweizens.Jul 19, 2019"
Stephans Brau Hefeweizen,3.0,2.75,3.0,2.75,"Hazy amber beer, not very big white head, moderate retention.

Stephans Brau Hefeweizen,4.0,3.0,3.75,4.25,"Extremely better than I thought. It feels a bit mild at first - a boring taste. And then the after taste, yes; I can feel the silk-like soft fruity smell after the swallowing process. This must be that banana thing. This is pretty good! I'd say it's near the level of Hoegaarden. From where I live, this beer is extremely cost-efficient. Would recommend in a mid-high level.Jun 08, 2015"
Stephans Brau Hefeweizen,3.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,"0mL can. Brew date: Jan. 5, 2011; best by Apr. 5, 2012. 5.3% ABV, 11.8 degrees Plato.

Contract brewed for Kaufland grocery stores in Eastern Europe.

Appearance: Light golden with a touch of orange. Two fingers of dense, rocky foam with great retention. Not extremely cloudy, bubbles are easily seen swirling from its depths. Left a couple of rings of lacing.

Smell: More bubblegum than banana in the nose. Sweet.

Taste: Mslty, wheaty, yeasty, no real banana or cloves tastes. Slight bitterness, but also not overwhelmingly sweet either. Kind of ordinary.

Mouthfeel: Light to moderate body. Just a touch of carbonation on the palate. Finishes a bit dry.

Overall: Cloudy, check. Yeasty, check. Looks good in the glass, check. But it doesn't check near all the boxes for a great Hefeweizen. It is drinkable, even mildly refreshing, but I'd rather have almost any other Hefeweissbier that I have already had before this one again.Oct 04, 2011"
Martens Pilsener,4.0,3.5,3.75,3.5,"From a large can, this brew is clear, deep golden, and had a tall white head. Nice head stability. The smell is soft, with some pale malt and a little lager breadlines. Fuller inbox you than expected, and nickel balanced. Solid beer.Dec 31, 2016"
Martens Pilsener,1.75,1.75,1.0,1.25,"330ml bottle bought in Trinidad, Cuba (1.10 CUC):
This one was terrible from start to finish, cheap & nasty with very little in the way of flavour; I was surprised to learn that this one is also available in Belgium & not just for the Cuban market. There was a generally bad taste running through the beer with some skunky bitterness & cheap adjuncts distracting you at times but this really was a terrible beer & one that should definitely be avoided.Dec 16, 2016"
Martens Pilsener,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours clear bright and golden. Good head that lasts well and clings all the way down. Nose is grassy hop and a soft clean malt. Drinks a bit peppery and shows some of the spice form hop . Clean finish with a lasting bitterness that does not drive the malt softness away. This malt is creamy and a bit tempered by softness and by the soft grasses from hops. The floral on the palate is understated but on the nose it's just there. Crisp round finish. A little sulfur on the nose as it warms. Pleasant euro style pils.Sep 16, 2016"
Martens Pilsener,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.75,"A light golden colour with little head. Smells like pear. A very light tasting beer but very refreshing. Tastes of light fruit. Enjoyable overall. Would be fantastic on a nice summer day.Mar 14, 2016"
Martens Pilsener,3.25,3.0,3.25,3.25,"Yellow pour, white head, 3/5"", clarity up there. Aroma was neutral. 

Taste hit all the usual noble hop notes, mild super mild malt notes, lively carbonation appropriate for style. Floral. Cheap beer if you need your Euro lager kick, this one doesn't have the skunky vibe so much though.Feb 29, 2016"
Martens Pilsener,3.75,3.0,3.0,4.5,"I was thirsty and this beer quenched that thirst. It certainly looks nice my Samuel Adams glass. No appreciable aroma. It tasted slightly honey-sweet but finished with a strange but not terribly unpleasant metallic twang. Pleasant velvety mouthfeel. Not bad. Probably a summer beer or something to be sampled when thirsty.Dec 31, 2015"
Martens Pilsener,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.0,"This beer is a decent Belgian take on the German pils. Rather sweet as pilsners go, and a little watery, but a good refreshing summer beer to wash off the heat. Also had a nice fluffy white head.Jun 28, 2015"
Martens Pilsener,3.5,3.25,3.25,4.0,"This beer pours a light straw, almost yellowish color. Minimal aroma, reminds me of a decent laer on the nose. The flavor is biscuity, with just a hint of pilsner funk. The texture is where this beer really shines. Large, plentiful bubbles make this an awesome thirst quencher on a hot day. Is it the best pilsner around? No way, but it is certainly good option when you want something fizzy and simpleJun 21, 2015"
Martens Pilsener,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"L: Pours brilliant gold under a 2” white foam collar that dissipates to the thick film. 
S: Light grainy pils malt, no fruit, diacetyl or DMS in the aroma, light hops. 
T: Sweet and malty for the style with the carbonation and hops providing some balance in the finish. 
F: Highly carbonated, medium light body, smooth, no warming, no astringency, slight carbonation bight on the tongue 
O: This is a decent but not outstanding member of the style.Jun 09, 2015"
Martens Pilsener,3.75,3.25,3.25,3.75,"Golden yellow color. Fluffy white head. No visible carbonation present. Aroma is mild, biscuity, gummy, and some kind of hops are noticed.

Martens Pilsener,2.75,3.0,2.75,2.75,"Purchased at The Beer Store for just under $2.00 for a 500ml can. Served at 4deg C in a draught glass.

A- Opens well and pours a tiny white head that is gone in no time. Medium gold and clear

T- A bit woodsy. Metallic. Mushroom flavor. 

M- A typical Pilsner.

Martens Pilsener,4.0,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured into a fluted pilsener glass.

Look: Clear light golden color. White head with a film of retention. World map lacing.

Aroma: Malts, grains, grassy notes.

Taste: Grainy and malty up front, lemongrass follows, tangy finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied.

Overall: Not overly grassy, lots of good grains and malts. Good.Jun 15, 2014"
Martens Pilsener,4.0,3.25,3.5,3.75,"Poured from 500mL tall can into a pint glass.

Appearance: rich golden hue with a haze-free body and a pretty strong effervescence. Head is two fingers of frothy white foam leaving a nice lace on the glass. Pretty damn good looking!

Smell: sweet and grainy; reasonable for the style but not terribly character-ful. 

Taste: similar to the aroma; lightly sweet malt with a bit of graininess. The balance is pretty good, though, and it comes off as more appealing than the aroma.

Mouthfeel: medium-light body with a good carbonation and a reasonably good creaminess.

Overall: the flavor is pretty good and its refreshment quotient seems pretty high. It's a darn drinkable beer; I'll have to remember it for tailgating!Jan 16, 2014"
Martens Pilsener,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"i bought this beer because the price was comparable to one of the 3 big American beers that i normally drink. i figured that a bottom shelf Belgium beer would still be much better than what normally drink. it is not better. it is bitter and not in a good way. it left an after-taste than is unacceptable. the buzz was only fair.Dec 14, 2013"
Martens Pilsener,3.75,3.0,3.25,3.5,"A: Pours a crystal clear medium yellow in color with light to moderate amounts of active visible carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass and some golden yellow highlights. The beer has a two finger tall foamy off-white head that slowly reduces to a mottled thick film covering the entire surface of the beer and a medium thick ring at the edges of the glass. Significant amounts of lacing are observed.

S: Light to moderate aromas of grainy malts with some light notes of bready malts as well. There is a light presence of grassy hops and just a touch of skunkiness.

T: Upfront there is a light to moderate flavor of grainy malts combined with some light flavors of sweet bready malts. That is followed by light amounts of grassy hops which impart a light amount of lingering bitterness.

M: On the lighter side of medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Crisp.

O: While I am reviewing this beer, it is currently listed here on BA as a Euro Pale Lager while the brewer describes it as a Pilsener (German not Czech) but I am still comparing it to a Pilsener as the brewer describes it... It is easy to drink and not offensive but it certainly does not stand out as one of the better examples of the style in my opinion. I can't say that I would recommend this one but I also would not suggest that one should avoid it either.Nov 05, 2013"
Martens Pilsener,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,"Poured into straight pint glass. Poured a clear golden yellow color with less than 1/2 inch of white head that low retention and lacing.

The aroma was a benign version of the style. Slightly grainy and with very low hops. Same dealio on the tongue, just a generic tasting Pils.

The body may have been just a touch fuller than I like in the style, but was still crisp. Drinkability was good, the beer was gone quickly, and without memory. Overall, not a bad beer, but not a notable one either. Try it for the tick, or just have a fresh, local Pilsener.Aug 10, 2013"
Martens Pilsener,3.25,3.0,3.0,3.5,"500 ml can purchased from LCBO, served cold into a pint glass.

Appearance- Nice clear golden color. 1.5 fingers of white head with minimal retention time and lacing. Some bubbles present. 

Smell - Not much here, some grassy notes and some sweetness. Also some hop bite after a couple of whiffs. 

Taste - Clean and crisp with some pepper elements but very sweet for a pilsener although more appropriate for a EPL. Sweetness to me is reminiscent of Munich Helles Lager. Keeping with the theme ,there is sweet aftertaste too.

M- Clean, crisp, nicely balanced and not exessively carbonated. Medium finish. 

Overall - too sweet for repeated consumption, but a nice change and a better alternative than many an EPL..Aug 05, 2013"
Martens Pilsener,3.75,3.25,3.25,3.0,"The fact that Martens Pilsener is a bit cloudy is a good sign. Many of the best pilsners I've had were unfiltered (or otherwise just clouded). And that's not to take away from the fact that this golden, solid-looking beer is in fact transparent and well burnished. Factor in the decent amount of head and it's safe to say that this is a decent, if conventionally aesthetic beer. 

The aroma, though respectable enough for a mass-produced lager, is not immune to the tarnish of adjuncts (nor, alarmingly, of alcohol). Sugars were definitely added. The corn syrup-y musk is not sufficient to turn me away entirely, but we're not off to the best start and it's certainly enough to enforce the sense that this is going to be a pretty run-of-the-mill offering. 

Martens Pilsener is for those people who prefer plain toast and unflavored potato chips - its flavour is light and basic. Though largely insipid, it has some cereal grain notes, a most welcomed trace of earthy hops and a surprising amount of body. In a way it drinks more like a true pilsner - as opposed to swill lager - albeit one with all the frills cut out. 

It is in the aggregate that unseen details become visible; while the flavour is palatable enough, the use of corn and sugar adjuncts gives the mouthfeel a terribly starchy texture and also creates an overly sweet, off-putting aftertaste (one that fortunately fades in the time it takes me to make a few strokes on the keyboard). Still, I'm bizarrely left with a parched sensation. 

Martens Pilsener is way closer to an actual pilsner than most commercial Belgian or Dutch brands advertised as such (cough, Stella, cough). Despite being “like” a pilsner, however, it isn’t - it falls foul to the same off-putting adjuncts and incompleteness as most every mass-produced lager. I honestly didn't mind the few tall cans I drank, but let's call a spade a spade...Jan 31, 2013"
Martens Pilsener,3.0,3.0,3.75,3.5,"If there was a category for value, this would score highly. Even as an import, it is $4.99 for a four pack of tallboys at Total Wine. With an abv of 4.8, it's a definite improvement over American competitors. It is smooth, has no aftertaste to speak of (okay, I did taste the can), is not too sweet or hoppy, and is very affordable. If you tried craft beer because you were tired of PBR and the like, you can revisit the best of your past with this working man's import, without an obnoxious price point, skunkiness, or unexpected flavors from added impurities. Just good beer, pure and simple, unadorned and great on ice. Somewhere, a Belgian truckdriver knows what I mean.Jan 09, 2013"
Martens Pilsener,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A-Nice light golden color...clear...

S-Grainy malt....sweeter, breadier impression...not spicy at all..maybe a little musty

T-Grainy...bready....lightly hopped for a pilsner...just a light saaz like hop note late..

M-Light side of medium bodied....maybe high side of light bodied :)
Easy drinking....nice light malt flavor with just a kiss of hops..lower carbonation makes this drink real easy..

O-This is a real nice drinking lager...not an assertive pilsner by any means and I first I was a little disappointed as I was hoping for that. But if you accept it for what it is, it is still enjoyable. I wonder if this is what American Lager tasted back in the day....Aug 25, 2012"
Martens Pilsener,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,"Picked this up from a local bottle shop. Pounder can with a 25/6/12 date on the bottom.

Poured a pale golden color. Formed about two fingers of fluffy head that slowly disappeared in to some pillowy foam. It left plenty of thin lacing along the glass.

Really not too much going on in the nose. Some hops and an aroma of grains. Some light lemon. Kind of drab, but clean and inoffensive.

Grain and a light sweetness. More flavor than in the nose. A bit grassy in the hop department. Light on the flavor, but it was consistant and didn't taper off. 

Very smooth with an incredibly clean finish. Light body. Seemed to have pretty mild carbonation for a pilsner. 

Pretty decent and inoffensive pilsner. The aroma and flavor were there, but it was a little bit on the delicate side. Might make for a nice tailgate or BBQ beer if you're looking for something light that will still have some decent flavor.Aug 06, 2012"
Martens Pilsener,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,"Snagged a four-pack of cans in Iowa. The expiry date printed on the bottom of the can (which is not visible when the cans are in their plastic wrapper) says it expires the day after tomorrow. Whew!

Pours darkly into an old High Life pils glass, fizzy and translucent with a really nice, fluffy white head.

Smells rich yet delicate. Nothing too fancy--pils malt, dry floral noble hops--but the balance is excellent. Tastes like it smells. The hops are nearly dry or strong enough for this to qualify as a German pils, but it's got a bit more bit to it than your average Euro Pale. It's like the missing link between Stella and Urqell, lacking the oldtimey unfiltered character of Sam Smiths' lager, but still more interesting than, say, Carlsberg.Jun 24, 2012"
Martens Pilsener,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,"Picked up a can mixed-n-match for $1.75

A - Pours a light straw colored yellow with some damn impressive head/lacing for a Pilsener.

S - Smells of mild grains, really mild hops, some sour apple funk and a touch of lemon grass. 

T - It's really not that bad in fact it taste better than most Euro lagers I have had. In no way offensive when it gets warm. Taste is mostly grain forward, sweet malts, and a touch of sour apple/tart lemon.

M - Light to medium as expected.

Nice looking golden color with a 2F white cap that drops to a lasting film and leaves a bit of lacing. It’s see through with lots of active bubbles.

Pungent floral hops and strong grassy aromas. Honey crackers.

The hop flavors are soft floral and herbal. Light spice and malt. A hint of licorice.

Pure Lager,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,"Some other reviews described this as clear. Mine is hazy. Could be something is off with mine, could be they were wrong, who knows. I'm just reviewing the beer I have in front of me. This one is slightly hazy. I'm not complaining about it though. Head is exactly what you expect of a lager. Nose gives a hint of biscuit malt, then grassy hops. Some reviews mentioned tasting more malt than hops. I found the opposite. There's barely a hint of faint malt, if anything that's more in the mouthfeel. The taste starts like a clean and crisp but generic lager, then finishes with pleasantly strong and bitter grassy hops. Goes down easy, crisp, refreshing, but the hops on the tail end have a slightly drying effect that I don't dislike. Overall a solid example of a well brewed lager. Not outstanding, but solid.Aug 20, 2021"
Pure Lager,3.75,4.0,4.25,4.0,"Carbonated golden yellow with a quickly dissipating soapy head. Very inviting aroma of cracker malt and crisp grassy hops. Taste is fresh with slight diacetyl taste.

From that, I get April 22, 2020. 

So, 1 year old.

Let's see how this beer aged.

Crystal clear golden yellow body with columns of bubbles rising to a 1 inch white, thick head. The head recedes fairly quickly leaving sticky lacing clinging to the glass.

In the aroma, I get grass, biscuit, and fruit - apple or pear.

The flavors in the taste repeat the aroma, with just a touch of bittering initially that fades a bit, but does hang on into the finish and aftertaste. The apple/pear flavors are quite pleasing and blend well with the grass and biscuit. There is a solid bready maltiness as well. The hops add just enough bitterness to keep the beer balanced, crisp, and refreshing.

The mouth feel is on-point for the style. It is thin, for sure, but it has a nice presence on the tongue. A bit creamy as well.

Overall, this beer seems to have survived its age and poor treatment in reasonably good shape. I can see why this beer is #1 in its style. It's only too bad I didn't get a fresh one to try.Apr 09, 2021"
Pure Lager,4.0,3.75,3.25,4.0,"Pours sparkling and gold, nice head of soft foam, smells a bit underwhelming, nothing notable. Carbonation is very fine and crisp, the body is excellent. Very grassy (or hay), a little spicy, and then very quickly with each sip an unexpected musty/metallic flavor kicks in at the finish. Not totally unenjoyable or ""bad,"" but not something I would seek out again. There are many other lagers that easily surpass this.Mar 18, 2021"
Pure Lager,3.75,2.75,2.75,3.0,"Currently ranked #1 in the ""Lager - European Pale"" top beers list.

14.9 fl oz/440ml pull-tab can nabbed in 4 pack form for $10.99 USD plus tax at Total Wine & More, Metairie, Louisiana. Can lacks a canned on/best before date.

""Pure brewed organic lager beer."" 5.0% ABV.

Served cold into a dimpled mug.

APPEARANCE: In a word, classic. Head is of an apt white hue and boasts ample frothiness, promising a creamy beer. Body is a clear well-filtered vibrant yellow. As transparent and clean in appearance as they come, lacking any chill haze or visible yeast/lees.

Head retention is impressive (~10+ minutes). Head height is about 2-3cm when well poured.

Looks apt for the style. I'm eager to try it.

AROMA: Creamy biscuity pale malts, crisp 2-row, grassy hops, low minerality, and a scintilla of pear. Initially, I thought I was getting a sort of creamed corn note, but I think it may just be 6-row?

Aromatic intensity is average.

TASTE & TEXTURE: Creamy and soft on the palate, with a smooth wet and not unrefreshing mouthfeel. Well carbonated.

I can't say I adore its flavour profile, in all honesty. Has a cheap taste to it I'd attribute to 6-row barley, and the subtle hop flavour - while grassy enough to indicate Noble hops were used - isn't terribly impressive. A biteen buttery, a biteen evocative of corn though none was used. Very simplistic and shallow, lacking the depth of malt flavour I'd hoped for in a top tier lager.

OVERALL: I don't dislike it but it's not a standout lager especially compared to its German competition. I'd sooner drink Vedett or Black Isle's Organic Blonde...this is drinkable but it's not top tier fare and I doubt it'd perform well in any blind taste test. Maybe I just got an old can that's sat on shelves at Total Wine unrefrigerated for months, but the brewers' lack of date codes put that possibility on their shoulders. Sure, I'll try it again on-draught if I come across it in the U.K., but I'm finding it pretty unremarkable out of a can.

Pure Lager,3.5,3.75,4.5,4.0,"Appearance:
Very pretty Crystal clear medium gold, BUT... Sudsy head that does not last or lace.

Mouthfeel:
Light body, moderate CO2, and no harshness. Feels great.

Overall: 
A top-tier European Pale Lager. No vegetal or garbagey character so often found in this style category. The flavor and feel is so very nice. Nearly flawless, except for the lack of heading , which makes it harder to get a good read on the aroma.Feb 19, 2021"

Pure Lager,4.0,4.0,4.25,4.25,"Smooth herbal hoppiness with a string crackers malty base. This version of the style just seems to have a malty base that complements the hops making it a nice beer though still a medium bodied beer.Aug 26, 2020"

T: A slightly buttery, bready chew followed by subtle hop bitterness.

F: The character of the yeast is most apparent in the finish.

Pure Lager,3.25,3.75,4.25,4.75,"*Poured into a Teku glass from a 550mL bottle*

Looks a predictably pale yellow and clear with a thin layer of white head and low retention. Not a whole lot to say here!

Definitely could smell the malted barley on this. It wasn't too strong of a smell, but it was definitely the dominant aroma here. I could pick up on some clove notes, but not much else. It wasn't very complex smelling, but I was glad to find that it smelled ""clean and fresh"" with absolutely no off smells.

Immediately when tasting, I could see that this tasted very light and refreshing to me. Absolutely no bitterness to it, and had a predominant barley taste to it in the front, middle, and back. It was biscuit-y, light, refreshing, and no aftertaste to it what-so-ever.

Like I said before, this was super refreshing to me. It had no lingering bitterness or aftertaste, and also had a light body and a low-medium carbonation--making this super drinkable, crisp and clean. I would definitely use this to cook some meat in, but it would also be really good to pair with some Korean pork belly and other fatty meats to cut back the oiliness.Apr 29, 2020"
Pure Lager,4.25,4.0,4.5,4.5,"A- This brew pours a nice light straw color when coming out of the bottle, which by the way is a favorite of mine....the style. After the bubbles settle down, we are treated to a yellow tinged, light golden color, with a frothy white head that shows excellent retention, starting about 2.5 fingers thick and settling down to a solid one finger. The relatively clear beer shows delicate, lumbering carbonation rising to the top in only a couple of columns, and shows off a lacing that is also excellent, leaving behind cave art inspired drawings around the inside of the glass. 

S- Six Row Barley sweetness, crystal and caramel malts, slight grassy dryness, cracker/biscuit yeast, and perhaps some honeyed/caramel character. The finish is clean, crisp and is of soft noble hop bitterness. Overall this has a typical, but more pronounced quality lager aroma.

T- The blend of malt sweetness and hop bitterness interchange throughout the taste, and makes this a well rounded, flavorful lager. Underlying notes of dry grains and grassy flavors, slight caramel, soda biscuit/wafer cleanliness, and the finish lingers with soft hop bitterness, and toasted barley kernels. Quite nice.....no adjuncts used here!

M/O- Full bodied for a lager style.....so probably medium overall. The carbonation is soft, which is different and pleasant on the palate, as I can appreciate the rich flavors that are present. This would make a great pairing with a BBQ meat, or with a spicier dish, as it would cut through any hot oily dish. Quite sociable, I am glad to have finally tried this one, and recommend it for a true lager lover!Apr 26, 2020"
Pure Lager,4.0,3.75,3.75,4.0,"From the bottle, it pours a clear straw color with a moderate sudsy head. The head retains very well and yields lacing.

The nose opens with a touch of grassy and floral hops. This is immediately followed by aromas of biscuity malt and notes of yeast that combined with the malt evoke a jammy and marmalade like sweetness. 

The taste opens cleanly and with a crisp mouthfeel. The body is medium and the carbonation is moderate to lively. As the flavors develop, it begins with a hint of grainy sweetness that becomes more biscuity, and with hints of caramel/toffee, as it opens up. This beer really grows unto itself as the hops spices become unlocked and create a nice balance. They yield a subtle earthy bitterness along with floral and grassy flavors. 

This grew on me as the hops to malt balance developed. Well crafted with a deft and delicate touch.Apr 24, 2020"
Pure Lager,4.5,4.0,4.25,4.5,"Somehow I missed this one. A great wrong has been righted! Or something like that. Bubbly yellow classic lager body with a sudsy white head.

Pure Lager,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,"This one pours a very clear straw yellow color, with a small fluffy head, and lots of lacing.

This one smells like grassy and floral hops, sweet honey malt, and a touch of breadiness.

This is very simple, but well brewed. There's a nice sweet floral and mineral-like flavor here, with some crisp grassy hops, and a nice biscuity malt thing going on. It's very well constructed, and no one flavor dominates.

This is light bodied, crisp, and super clean, with a really nice drinkability.

Nose has a surprisingly bright herbal/floral character with some faint and clean breadiness and a lightest nip of citrus. Really pleasant and aromatic for a light lager. 
Taste follows along with a wonderfully clean pale malt flavor and a wonderfully floral light bitterness. Quaffable in the extreme, can't believe this is my first taste of this. This is a really great, really easy drinking, highly beer flavored beer. It's a pale lager, the flavors aren't gigantic but it is a pleasure and has more going on than I expected.
Mouthfeel is wonderfully crisp and clean. It's a light lager and it drinks like water. You can certainly imagine putting these down by the tankard

Brooklyn Lager,4.25,3.25,3.75,4.0,"Surprised I have not had this one yet.
BBD of 5/2021. 
Into White Elm Willie Beecher. 

Has a copper orange body - looks like this is a vienna lager or an amber lager - with a butter colored head of 1 finger. Moderate haze, moderate clarity. Lots of webbed lacing. 

Aromas of hop spoilage and strawberry, with some caramel malt and onion skin. 

Flavor is your typical amber lager but is crisper and more defined. I would say this is a stronger effort than SA's Boston Lager by a mile, and most any other ""micro macro"" amber lager you can get (New Belgium, Yuengling, Naragansett, Sierra Nevada, etc). Has a distinct toasted malt flavor with some underlying fruity esters (strawberry, lemon, orange) with a nip of pine on the finish. Unfortunately this one has fallen to hop spoilage as well, so it's not quite as enjoyable. This was partially my fault as it is nearing the end of its shelf life. 

Feel is crisp and tight, very busy with carbonation, exciting and poppy like an Amber lager should be. Drying, crisp finish. No sign of alcohol. 

Overall, a decent Amber that I'd be willing to try a fresh can of. It's not going to blow your mind of course, but will do just fine at a sporting event, casino, bar, or bowling alley. Recommended.

The color is a deep golden amber color with a nice white head. There is also a nice amount lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is Rich with heavy grains and malts. Then there is a nice mix of hop bitterness. So far this is a nice inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Bold with flavors. Lots of nice malts an grains an the hops tie it all together. The body of this Lager brew is a solid medium. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a super nice balance to it. I really enjoy how smooth this brew goes down. This brew would go nice with lunch or dinner. If you are looking for a soild lager style brew, this is it. The mouth feel is Bold, Rich, Clean, Smooth, and Refreshing.

I'm torn on this one. On one hand, its a fine beer. On the other, its quite unlike any amber lager I've had before, and reminded me more of an aged imperial west coast red ALE I've recently had. This is where marketing, innovation, and expectations can make scoring tricky. I had purchased an IPA, but this has made it seem redundant!Sep 23, 2020"

Brooklyn Lager,3.75,3.75,3.0,3.25,"look: one finger slightly off white head with good retention and lots of lacing. amber coloured beer, of course, more or less clear with loads of carbonation in the beer.

smell: a nice balance of hops and malts, a lot of malt sweetness there, but also some bready biscuity flavours, some grassy flavours too, but also a hoppy snap, with some bitter citrus aromas, orange and lemon zest.

taste: taste is more subdued than the aroma but it’s still pleasant, those malt flavours don’t really shine, there’s definitely a caramel sweetness though, certainly a hoppy bitter finish, a tad metallic, some lemon and orange flavours.

feel: light bodied, medium to high carbonation, crisp and refreshing.

overall: a classic beer, always found it hard to get in ireland but my local supermarket has started stocking it now which i suppose is good, this is a real good transition beer from macro to craft for those looking to dip their feet into craft waters, but ultimately it is just a passable lager.May 08, 2020"
Brooklyn Lager,3.75,2.75,1.5,3.5,"I have had a couple of Brooklyn’s brews before, I decided to try their basic “Hoppy Amber Lager.” I will write the review as I do each step (new approach). 

Appearance: crystal clear golden-orange. White head that leaves a fairly dense film across the top (this is a standard laser cut pint glass). A little on the gold side of gold-orange. Lots of lacing. 

I let it sit for about 10 minutes to air out and get a little warmer to let the flavors come out. 

Smell: aside from dry hop, there is a hint of bready malt and some citrus (could be from the hops). Seems pretty straight forward, but smells more like an ale. 

Taste: This does not taste like an Amber Lager hardly at all. Very hop forward, not balanced by malt. It is not easy to drink when you’re expecting a lager, but it gets easier while it sits. Possibly one of my least favorite Amber Lagers (one of my favorite styles). Dirty finish of hops. 

Feel: medium-light body, okay carbonation level, wet finish. 

Overall: not a beer I will be buying again anytime soon, and it a hard for me to say that. This is more like someone tried to make an Amber Lager, and wound up messing up their recipe and decided to make a hybrid between an Amber Ale and an IPA/IPL. This beer is not to style, and I do not recommend it unless you think IPL’s are the pinnacle of beer (which they are not). It tastes almost as if someone followed the recipe to Sam Adams Boston Lager (to me is more of an ale), then decided to ramp up the hops and shorten the brew process to 2 weeks. It is actually reminiscent of the old Sam Adams Rebel line of IPA’s.Jan 18, 2020"

It has a mild taste of bready malts, pine, and grapefruit with slight sweetness. The mouthfeel is light bodied, somewhat dry, with soft bitterness and light carbonation. The aftertaste has a mild, grapefruity bitterness to it.

Brooklyn Lager,4.5,2.5,2.75,4.5,"Appearance: Brilliant amber color, great clarity
Mouthfeel: What you would expect from a lager
Aroma: None really, slight carbonation sting on the nose
Taste: When I had this, I thought it was a strange lager that basically wanted to be an old-school ale by putting in tons of caramel malt and cascade. Turns out I was exactly right, which was pretty disappointing as I was wanting a lager. Almost sickly sweet caramel flavor with some piney/citrusy flavor to it. Small hint of vienna malty-ness comes through, but pretty much drinks like your old school pale ale. 
Overall: Seems like an ancient beer from the mid 90's when craft beer was trying to gain a foothold, so they made a ""lager"" that would bring in the budweiser drinkers who only knew lagers. It was probably good for the time, but a beer like this wouldn't even make it to flagship status at a new brewery nowadays. Not an awful beer by any means, but f you want a darker lager don't go with this.Sep 29, 2019"

Brooklyn Lager,3.5,4.0,4.25,4.0,"This lager seems to generally be underrated. It tries a little harder than most and thus succeeds in putting a little umph usually missing in this style.

It is not a pretty red, more of a dirty copper. The head is good. The aroma is a bit stankier than yer garden variety lager. It pushes the envelope with finishing hops.

The taste is a much more bitter experience than you would expect, all thanks to a high dosage of hops. It all still seems appropriate for the style. It lingers like a much stronger brew than it is. That is success.

This thing pour beautifully, all black and foamy. The lacing continues to impress. The smell is a let down as it is just slightly roasty. Mocha? Maybe. The taste is similarly disappointingly bland. I wanted a bigger malty taste and it was just adequate. I found myself liking it more as I drank, and it would not offend if I had two to drink, but it might bore after that.

Not recommended. You can find a better porter without looking too hard.Sep 22, 2017"
Rogue Mocha Porter,5.0,4.75,4.75,5.0,"Rogue Mocha Porter
5.6% ABV. 54 IBU's American Porter
Look: Pitch black, inch. tan head that dissapates to a tiny ring, little lacing.
Smell: Coffee, dark malts, bread and cacao
Taste: Coffee, dark chocolate, roasty bitterness, goes down smooth and has a bitter aftertaste. 
Feel: The feel is almost akin to a Guinness, but not as thin.
Overall: Whether, or not the coffee is added during the brewing process, it ends up being a really well balanced porter that feels more like a stout. I did not see any red hues to the ale even when held up to the light.Jun 29, 2017"
Rogue Mocha Porter,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Pours a dark brown close to black color and leaves the same colored body with a one and a half finger rocky white head that rises, holds for a good minute and dies at a gentle pace; lacing is actually kinda all over the place, I mean its there, its just sporadic and messy; the aroma has mocha coffee up front with a nice dosing of cocoa to add a nice sweetness to it; slightly roasty yet sweet; the taste is bittersweet - combined nicely through the coffee and cocoa, and even as it warms it stays balanced and still has a nice roastiness to it; no aftertaste, dry finish; its pretty easy on the palate and sessionable; overall, a porter well worthy of coming back to in the winter months.Jun 25, 2017"

Rogue Mocha Porter,4.0,3.25,2.75,3.75,"Pours a dark brown, nearly black, body that seems disproportionately transparent at thinner amounts. A creamy but thin light tan heady forms only to disappear to wisps. The nose offers wet stone and a bit of chocolate; it's disappointingly mild. The flavor only gets worse: more wet stone, which itself isn't unpleasant but should work more as a supporting role, soap, very mild chocolate, and bitterness. No mocha, barely any porter. Body is good, with a medium-heavy weight and some creaminess but is a tad flat.

Rogue Mocha Porter,4.75,3.5,4.0,3.25,"From notes taken 02/23/17:

Reddish brown and clear in most of the pour itself, but in the glass it might as well be black. Very opaque with final pour with some fine tannish particles in suspension. Medium-brown, creamed-coffee looking head of pillowy fluff on top of fine albeit rocky foam. Great retention. Toast, medium-roast coffee, semi-sweet chocolate, caramel to the nose. Even more coffee forward on palate, and quite dark chocolatey as well. Somewhat roasty and soily and tart but not quite as rich as others of similar style, making it seem almost smoky. Well-balanced with earthy, leathery, and herbal to nearly spicy hops for an overall pipe smoke sensation. Peppery, boozy, smoky retro-olfaction, somewhat strong and long-lasting. Medium-bodied, light to medium level of extra fine but sparse and tingly carbonation. Lower astringency and even acidity than expected from flavors.Feb 24, 2017"

Rogue Mocha Porter,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.0,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into pint glass in December 2016. I did not see any brewed on or drink by dates on the bottle.

Appearance: Deep black with thick dark tan head. Beer is thick and not hazy. Head is thicker than average, with alot of lacing on the glass. 

Smell: Aroma filled with sweet malts and coffee, with some hops. Interesting variety and balance. Love the hops in the aroma.

Taste: There is a sweet and creamy porter, and tastes more like a Stout than a porter. There is some bitterness from the hops and some coffee and chocolate flavors to balance the hops. The hops were not as pronounced as they are in teh aroma. There is a moderate alcohol bite as well. This was done in a nice combination with the other flavors. There is a great variety of flavors in the aftertaste too.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium alcohol level, which confirms the 5.3% on the bottle. Maybe a little too much creaminess like a cream stout.

This is a very smooth, complex, and creamy porter. It is an interesting combination of flavors, especially with the coffee, chocolate, and a bitterness from the hops. I like this and would drink it again. One of my favorites from Rogue.Dec 10, 2016"

Rogue Mocha Porter,4.25,4.0,4.0,3.75,"A beautifully dark porter, but with a short-lived head and no lacing to speak of. The strong scent of chocolate is certainly distinct that comes with a light almost distance smell of porter. The mouthfeel was very up and down for me - in the end I just couldn't over look the carbonation and the tacky, distracting after taste. The taste was very good though, a solid porter with a slightly sweet, slightly tart chocolaty taste - distinctive and unique. Overall, though not as strongly flavored with chocolate as other's of its kind, it's definitely a great porter and I will look for more during the impending holidays.Nov 14, 2016"

The aroma consists of chocolate, burnt caramel, roasted malts, mocha and a whiff of alcohol. Very nice.
Smooth in the mouthfeel, almost creamy and mocha like. The carbonation is gentle but slightly tingly. There is a coating of sweetness from the malts; burnt caramel and chocolate. The roasted malt, mocha/coffee and hops bitterness. Slightly nutty and even some spice from the hops. Medium bodied and light for a Porter. Drinkable and even seasonable. I liked it overall.Nov 12, 2016"
Rogue Mocha Porter,4.0,4.25,4.25,4.0,"One of my favorite beer styles from a great brewery, so I have pretty high expectations for this one. This porter pours a very dark black, with a barely detectible red tint. There is a medium, frothy, light tan head. The smell is very pleasant, with some strong roasted grain notes, sweet chocolate mocha, and a light espresso. The taste is much the same. The roasted grain notes are very bold and come to the forefront, but there is a significant mocha presence as well, which is more sweet chocolate than coffee oriented, but not as much so as in smell. There is a measured bitterness in the aftertaste and a slight dryness as well. The body is heavy to a degree that is fitting for the style. This is a bold porter that lives up to my expectations for the most part. It lacks some polish to be sure, being a little overly carbonated and a little lacking in smoothness. However, I think it is definitely underrated. There are better, but it’s a very good porter in my opinion.Nov 01, 2016"

Rogue Mocha Porter,3.75,4.5,3.75,4.0,"Poured to a teku glass.


A: The body is pure black with a beige to brown head, just like an expresso's head. The beer appears to have some lacing but minor head retention.
S: The aroma is great. There's a hoppy accent, very smooth, on a pile of coffee and specially cocoa. This smells wonderfully good.
T: The taste is an extension of the aroma using the hoppiness as a base for the coffee and cocoa profiles. I was actually expecting the coffee to be more powerful than any other flavor but the cocoa is really strong here, specially because it's no milk chocolate variation or a very sweet one. Instead, it's a bitter almost 100% cocoa that's present in the beer and that makes this specific taste be over everything else.
M: The mouthfeel is very consistent, dense and smooth. It's actually more liquor-y than beer-y. :)
O: For a coffee induced beer, this is not the best experience available. I'd say that, besides the aroma, all other characteristics are almost average. But it's an always good to go beer when available.Jul 12, 2016"

The cheap beer with added value. 

On pour a lot of carbonation producing a very clear golden colour. A big bubbly white head appears which does die a death pretty fast to leave a small flat head. No lacing. Appearance is ok, nothing special. 

Has a good beery smell, a bit faint but good all the same, yeasty, grainy….

Bit of a biting metallic taste, but goes and once you get over that the beer is quite enjoyable 

Can taste the malts, the grains and the yeast

All in the front taste, nothing remarkable in the back end which is a little bit dry.

Not bad. Smooth and filling, getting nice big creamy mouthfuls. 

Strong bitter hoppy taste might not be suitable for everyone, but it doesn’t hang around and I found it bearable.

Oettinger Export,2.5,2.5,1.5,2.0,"Glass 500ml bottle served into halleroder mini (.3L) stein in Leipzig, Germany. Bottle acquired in REWE stores, Berlin, Germany. Reviewed live. 

A: Pours a four finger head, quite thin and unappealing, lacking cream and of good retention. Transparent yellow colour. I'm surprised at the retention, as every other aspect of the appearance is garbage. 

Sm: Light barley and cream. Light strength but pleasant. 

T: Cream on the climax is the best feature. Simple craptastic barley open and watery notes - the kiss of death in my reviews. The barley is clean but almost stale. All in all, it's a bad taste. No real balance. Built terribly for the style (though so often beers in the style are built terribly, leading me to suspect perhaps this is an average crap lager). 

Mf: Smooth and wet. Too much so on both counts, but I am grateful for a lack of coarseness as I might have to experience the flavours of the body more if it were present. 

Dr: Relatively low ABV with a crap taste and an excellent price (~.40 Euro in Berlin). This is what we might politely call a ""student beer"". In terms of regional considerations, it's better than the crap cola porter mixes often seen on shelves alongside it in Germany, but that isn't saying a great deal.

T - grassy and slightly malty, with a little bitterness. After drinking for a bit, I started to get a bubblegum aftertaste.
M - carbonation isn't biting but is felt in the gut, each sip leaves the mouth dry, prompting more drinking.

S - A bit of a grassy hop smell along with some grain and vegetable aroma. Slight bready malt smell also makes it way through. In between a heavy cooked vegetable and a hoppy lager, with it being slightly closer to a cooked vegetable one.

T - Dominated by a grassy, hop bitterness. Some grainy and vegetable background, but not a lot of grain taste and almost no bready malt taste. 

M - Light body with high carbonation. Fizzy and crisp mouthfeel and fairly watery.

D - Not bad, but not great. It is light and provides some hoppy flavors, but it is a little one dimensional and not very balanced. It worked with the burger and hot dog I was having, but it doesn't really make me want another one, just a nice beer to have to drink.

The taste took the previously mentioned flavors and added a gentle rolling sticky pine underneath. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a slight sessionability about it. There’s a gentle harshness running about it - I mean its there, its just seems to be dampened a bit probably due to the involvement of the malts in this one.

Nose: Tropical fruit with some raisin and banana. A little citrus at the end.

Taste: Malt and hops play back and fourth. The hops comes in citrusy and zesty. It is quite sweet. Some grapefruit and orange in the end.

Notes: The brits may have done it first, but I don't think they do it best. This, however, is a very nice example of what an IPA can be.Mar 07, 2015"

S: Sweet malty cereal quality, banana candy, not a lot more than this so far. Perhaps a hint of orange candy or lollipop. 


T: A mean sweet and bitter balance, first sweet, then bitter on the palate. The same cereal candy quality comes in, a hint of orange lollipop, then a grapefruit pith like finish.


M: Medium balanced body, little fine carbonation. Smooth, but resinous coating is left on the back of the tongue.

Meantime India Pale Ale,4.25,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Poured from a 750ml caged & corked bottle into an imperial pint glass.

A: The beer is a deep gold color, with a large off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick but spotty lace on the glass.

S: The aroma contains caramelized malts, honey, citrus and a good amount of hops.

T: The taste starts out sweet with flavors of caramel, honey and citrus. Then a hearty malt character comes in. The hops presence is a bit subdued for the style but it’s complementary and provides a good balance. The after-taste is slightly sweet and slightly hoppy.

M: Crisp and smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.

O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a very solid beer to drink for a long time if you want an IPA with less of an edge than most.Apr 02, 2014"

Appearance: A one finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer. It is a slightly hazy pale orange color with some vision of bubbles coming up through the glass.

Smell: Some citrus fruitiness, pungent, floral, toasted, and caramel malts.

Taste: Herbal, citrus, chewy toasted malts, and sweet caramel to balance things out. Mild tingly bitterness in the rear.

Mouthfeel: A bit smooth, chewy, light to medium bodied, and medium carbonation.

Overall: For an EIPA, this is probably the best one that I have had so far. Hoppy, herbal, malty, and delicious.Mar 28, 2014"

Meantime India Pale Ale,3.75,3.75,4.0,4.0,"11.2 oz bottle poured into a small milkshake pilsner glass. Best before 24 01 15. Date stamp of L132053 13 56. 

Appearance: Hazy golden-amber. Thin off-white head. Some small islands and strands of persistent lacing, especially towards the bottom of the glass. 

Smell: Lemon, malt, some herbal hops. 

Taste: Pleasantly hoppy and bitter. Solid malt backbone with some notes of honey in the sweetness. A floral finish. 

Mouthfeel: Good carbonation, chewy, a bit sticky on the teeth. 

Overall / Drinkability: For the price of a small bottle, not something I would buy again. Good, but not amazing. However, if it were on cask in the UK at a lower price, I think I would definitely have another. A beer for savoring, and all the flavors come out at proper British beer temperatures. Let it warm up a bit to get the aromas and tastes. So a good beer overall, but rather expensive to have often or to drink a lot of.Jan 04, 2014"
Meantime India Pale Ale,3.5,4.0,3.75,4.25,"330ml bottles into a pint glass.

Pours a hazy medium gold with a one finger white head. Head quickly fades into just a tiny cap with some small splotches of lace on the sides of the glass.

The aroma is unique from many IPA's I have had. There is some orange and pineapple along with a bit of spice. Some grass and tree bark lending a very Earthy character. Even a touch of roast and wood. Pretty nice.

The flavor continues the earth, woody themes. There is just a small amount of orange but the majority of the flavor is grass, hay, and woods. There is a slight dankness just complimenting the Earth. Bitterness is on the moderate side with a slightly sweet, sticky finish. The flavor, I feel, fades out a little too quickly and I would like it to be a little punchier.

Overall, a pretty decent English IPA from a good brewery in England. I would really like to try some more of this brewery's beers.Sep 23, 2013"

Meantime India Pale Ale,3.75,3.75,4.25,3.5,"From the special Meantime bottle into a Brooklyn Brewery snifter.

A - The beer pours an amber/orange with a light, fluffy head that quickly dissipates and disappears. Brilliantly clear with a beautiful color.

S - Pine, toffee, caramel sweetness, a hint of honey maybe. Not a ton of depth to the hop character, but I think this is appropriate for an English IPA. Also not a lot of malts. Very restrained.

T - bitterness, floral hops, not piney like an American hop would be, but it does have a curious pine character to it. Less resiny and more like the pine needles.

M - The mouthfeel is sharp. Partially from the bitterness, and partially from what appears to be a high carbonation volume.

O - I think this is a good beer to the style, but it isn't really for me. I'll have to try their other beers available in my area.Jul 25, 2013"

Earthy yeast notes with pure liquid bread malt layers. Flavor is well meshed subdued hop bitterness with complex malt base orange fruit acidity from the alpha acids complement each other so well. Perfect hybrid aggressive hop flavors with complex malts still quite English in nature this is a must try IPA from across the pond.

Meantime India Pale Ale,4.0,3.75,4.0,3.5,"A: Pours a murky, hazy amber with a creamy, pillowy off-white head. Head retention is good and lacing is moderate.

S: Aromas of black tea, leather, white pepper, caramel, biscuits, toffee, tobacco, orange marmalade, lemon, honey, herbs, and cream fill the nose.

T: Notes of black tea, leather, caramel, biscuits, toffee, crackers, white pepper, tobacco, oak, cedar, orange, lemon, lime, honey, grass, herbs, and heavy cream wash across the palate. The finish is intense and punchy with notes of herbs, caramel, toffee, tea, pepper, biscuits, honey, and mild citrus undercut by a sharp alcohol burn.

M: Medium-in-body and dryish, but notably stickier and heavier than most English IPAs. Carbonation is delicate. Alcohol presence is detectable from the start, but intensifies immediately after the entry, lasting through the finish. This is definitely a sipping beer best suited for warm evenings.

O: I have long admired Meantime's desire to both innovate and faithfully recreate the styles of the past, but that being said, their actual beers are normally hit or miss for me. This IPA is not bad, but it is somewhat harsh, overly brash, and aggressive. It is definitely not the most drinkable example of the style. It does, however, display a commendable complexity and is solidly crafted. I would recommend this ale to fans of stronger British ales, especially those who fancy themselves EIPA connoisseurs.Jun 07, 2013"

L - Motor oil brown all the way through; a massive four-finger yeasty and thick tan head.
S - Fig, raisin, plum, and dark breads. A bit of cacao and a dry caramel aroma.
T - Stone fruit and burnt toast at first, then leading into a wonderfully complex fig and lightly-roasted coffee. Caramel is faint but present. Dry cacao throughout. Flavors slowly fade out into a dry raisin, and finish with toffee and walnut. Everything almost hints at sweetness, but it isn't sweet.
F - Thick. Boozy towards the end. Filling. Full body, light carbonation.
O - Although I've had this before, I haven't given it a formal review before. This is my favorite beer. Incredibly complex in every aspect, and delicious throughout all. Worth the price at least once; I highly recommend this brew!Oct 10, 2021"

Trappistes Rochefort 8,5.0,4.25,4.25,4.5,"Found this dusty on a shelf in my local deli, who knows how long it was there. Probably a really long time from the way it looked and the way the handwritten price was scrawled on a little round sticky on the top of this single. $5.49 it said. Must be a good price for a beer that has a 100/100 rating here. I'm very excited to try it as it's my first Trappist ale. Poured out into a clean snifter, light golden as it poured and darkening as it collected in the bottom of the glass. Nice inch of flaxen head that sticks around in a fluffy layer floating on top. Scent reminds me of banana and raisins predominantly and maybe some orange and grapefruit too. As i swirl the glass, the head foams up again robustly. Upon the first sip, I'm not as terribly impressed as i expected to be. Strong malt backbone, candies of butterscotch and sugary burnt bananas predominate. Also raisins, dates, figs. But it's also somewhat bitter with an earthy, musty type taste to it. Somewhat leathery. The 11% is well hidden and doesn't come through too strongly. Comes with a dry finish. Mouthfeel is full, well rounded, and highly carbonated. Overall it's a pretty good brew, but won't receive my highest marks. It's perhaps that I'm not trying several beers of this style in a row to pick the best. Perhaps my palate is still young and inexperienced. But regardless of what others say, I have to decide for myself. i tend to like big, heavy, thick, dense beers, with robust abvs, and maybe i was expecting the taste of a stout or porter. My only reference for this beer is really Golden Monkey, which I could just as easily pour if I wanted a beer of this style. Glad i tried it as it was quite the experience given the anticipation i had for this beer. However, i'm off to sample something a little heavier.Mar 13, 2021"
Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Picked up the 6, 8 and 10 all at once, a helluva deal in any circumstances.

Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.5,4.5,5.0,5.0,"Absolutely one of the very best beers I've ever had of any style.

Clean and crisp, with many complex subtleties that other have already described better than I could. It does a pretty good job of masking its ABV too, so be careful.

Pours a dark translucent brown with a fair amount of sediment. Initially the light tan head is tall and fluffy. It subsides to a light ring.

Smells of bread, yeast , brown sugar and raisins. Tastes of yeast, spice and raisins with a slightly bitter finish. The high alcohol level hides very well contributing some heat to the end of each sip.

Medium body and carbonation. Lush mouthfeel but lighter than I would have expected for a beer with such a big character.

Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.25,4.0,4.25,4.25,"As is the trend with all the Rocheforts, this has a muddle turbid appearance, with a slightly darker prune juice hue of brick red to brown, under a moderate, less active tan head that's softly convex, settling to a densely blanket that retains well.

Aroma is more subtle and restrained, but also mildly hoppy, while taste follows suit in that it is far more drinkable than 8, despite its slightly stronger ABV. I'm getting notes of sticky toffee pudding with fig and mincemeat via a moderately light but silky body whose carbonation is tingly and fine but expandingly airy, before coming to a semi-dry finish that has a slight prick of numbing heat. A second visit brings a touch of molasses and ginger snaps with hints of caramelized brown sugar, yet it remains slightly bitter by a lightly charred sort of element.

This is a far more balanced brew with a more deft hand and clearly--aside from its strength, which was probably a big deal in its day--this balance is what has kept its reputation so high.Oct 30, 2020"
Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,"This is a wonderful Quad, but the alcohol notes are a bit hot for me. I typically prefer sub 10% beers and have enjoyed 'worse' quads more because there are a bit cooler. Highly recommend for an experience, but not a favorite.Oct 21, 2020"

L: Really, really dark brown, borderline black, hard to see through. Creamy, frosty 1 finger head. Holds nice lacing.

S: The first smell, I get the same kind of characteristics I got from the Rochefort 6 and 8 - caramel, nutty. Although this one is different, there's dates, raisins, some hint of dark cherries singing in the background. A chocolate-rum (sign of some alcohol) cake nods its head and welcomes for a bite. In the distant horizon, a banana, cream kind of flavour shines through, maybe its my imagination?

T: I mean.. the nose was definitely interesting, but the taste blew me away. How this caramel, nutty, honey glazed toffe, banana, nuts, and everything else are so well balancend and easy drinking? From smelling I thought maybe its going to be a bit better than the middle brother, Rochefort 8, but it was really, really good.. Definitely tastes better than it smells.

F: So smooth, very well balanced, medium/high body, creamy nectar. 11.3% ABV? no way..

O: After drinking 6 and 8 from the family, which weren't that special, I expected that this is going to be a bit better, but not this good.

O- Perhaps refreshing on a hot summers day, but I find the overall sense of austerity unrewarding. Not one I'd buy again.

Meantime London Pale Ale,3.75,3.25,3.25,3.5,"i had this a couple of times around london on my trip there, and sometimes thought it was quite bad, and other times more tolerable, but suffice it to say this is not one of the better pales around anymore, if it ever was. is this the same as their old retired pale ale? i feel like it might still exist in both packages, any info there would be appreciated. its just okay for me, even when we caught it fresher. its got a little more malt to it than is fashionable nowadays, especially in the states, and has that weird slightly sharp meantime ale yeast i have noticed in their other beers over the years. its a little sweet, a little bit metal tasting like pennies, and with some bitterness from hops that dont carry much flavor. i guess its kind of old school and english, and i should appreciate it as such, but it really doesnt do much for me. its a bit filling for its lower alcohol content, and the high carbonation doesnt save it. there is just a weird metallic element and a tiredness, a sort of sag about the whole thing, i dont know, maybe some folks like this kind of pale ale, but it was lackluster at best for me several times around london...May 20, 2019"

I thought the mix of English and American hops was interesting and the malts were well-blended. But after my thirst was slacked, I noticed a metallic after-taste. It wasn't bad, it just wouldn't give me cause to have this again.

This is a popular beer. Meantime is a favored brewer of Marks & Spencer because Meantime's cans move off their shelf.
Meantime also was one of London's early crafter's in the late 20th Century that got big then. This EPA is listed in the ""1001 Beers To Taste Before You Die"" published eight years ago. There are many I've had on this trip that deserve to be on that list ahead of London Pale Ale.

The Meantime story seems analogous to Goose Island in Chicago. Both were bought by majors (after using its distribution prowess for about a decade.) Both continue in the whole lifestyle/quasi-community marketing strategy. We can argue about if corporatism and contract-brewing changes the beers, but one fact is certain: Goose Island was kept by AB and SAB quickly sold Meantime to Asahi. But it is all good because Chicago's craft world and London's craft world are both thriving.May 10, 2016"
Meantime London Pale Ale,4.0,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Pint at the Market Porter. 

A: Bronze, clear, lively looking, medium well retained head, clear. 

S: Noble hop, Hallertau? More Pilsner than Pale Ale. 

T: Sour dough, lots of rye bread gave way to fruity bitterness. 

M: Lots of carbonation, had a real snap to it. 

O: Seemed stronger than it was, I would probably revisit. More of a European than American take on a pale ale.Apr 17, 2016"

Meantime London Pale Ale,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Nose is muted, with a bit of earthy hops coming through from the EKG and a touch of American-style hops from the cascade. Not much there. Taste is not off, but dull and uninspired. A really average and forgetable pale ale.Aug 24, 2015"
Meantime London Pale Ale,3.25,3.5,3.25,3.75,"330mL bottle, poured into a balloon snifter. The aroma is a dank pine with orange and grapefruit notes that turn towards caramel with a light floral touch, and a leathery note. It's a brilliant, clear bronze hue with a thin, white soap head that has only a light retention and no lace. The taste is a moderate, balanced bittersweet. The thin oily texture is supported by a fizzy carbonation. The medium light body contains notes of caramel and leather with secondary notes of herbs and citrus. It finishes crisp with citrus and pine and has an aftertaste of floral pine and leather that's mild and leaves and astringent and clean aftertaste.Jun 04, 2015"
Meantime London Pale Ale,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A 330ml bottle with a BB of June 2015. Picked up a while back from a supermarket. The label mentions that this is hopped with Goldings and Cascade.

A: Poured into a cervoise. A deep orange-amber hue with some floating sediment and light carbonation. Yields a decent head of frothy white foam that lasts for a minute or so before collapsing to a patchy surface layer.

S: Aroma of sweet caramel malt with hints of subtle pine, mild weed, grass/hay, barley sugar, ale yeast and stewed hops. Pretty good.

T: Tastes of caramel malt and leafy hops with a restrained bitter finish. Notes of mild pine, weed, grass/hay, faint citrus, barley sugar, a touch of grain, ale yeast and stewed hops. Slightly sweet, followed by a subdued bitterness upon swallowing.

M: Mouthfeel is smooth, tingly and dry, with prickly carbonation and decent body. Somewhat astringent, accompanied by an aftertaste of stewed leaves/cardboard, caramel malt and faint ale yeast.

O: Not bad; won't blow you away though. Lacklustre looks - lack of carbonation and head. The aroma and flavour are alright, with a good caramel backbone and balanced hop bitterness. Body is OK. A satisfying pale ale that goes down easily enough. The only remark I have is that it isn't actually that pale. Worth trying.May 04, 2015"
Meantime London Pale Ale,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,"On draft, poured into imperial pint glass.

Meantime London Pale Ale,3.75,3.25,3.25,3.5,"First had poured from 330 ml bottle into Pilsner glass, and again a year later on draft at Meantime, The Old Brewery, Greenwich, London, into pint tulip. A mild English(-style) pale ale.Jan 07, 2015"
Meantime London Pale Ale,3.75,4.0,4.0,4.0,"30ml bottle poured into a Vedett tulip glass - bottle trade with a co-worker.

Look: Pours a dark amber with a fingers-width of white head. The head disappears pretty quickly to leave a diffuse froth cap and some lacing around the sides of the glass. Stand the beer long enough and this will disappear almost completely.

Smell: Earth and hops - it's a pale ale so that's not entirely unexpected. Not much in the way of fruitiness but it's there once the beer has warmed up a bit.

Taste: Again, it's a pale ale so it's very much hop-forward but not excessively so.

Taste: Very hop-forward but not as insanely bitter as some of the American IPAs. No malt or yeast was discernable but again, not entirely unexpected.

Feel: The word 'crisp' would probably sum it up quite nicely - a fair bit of a hop punch up front diminishing to some lingering astringence. Quite light, all other things considered, and eminently 'sessionable'.

Overall: My first encounter with the Meantime Brewery's output and unlikely to be my last - compared to other English pale ales it's not anything particularly special but taken on its own merits it's not bad at all. Interesting to note that Meantime do a lot of the 'own brand' beers for Marks & Spencer and the like. On the right side of good and worth trying if not particularly worthy of special attention.Dec 19, 2014"
Meantime London Pale Ale,4.0,3.5,3.75,3.75,"On tap at the bar in the St. Ermin's hotel, Westminster London, UK.

Appearance: a clear amber with a solid head.

Taste: excellent balance of fruit, spice, and herbs. Very little bitterness.

Mouthfeel: light

Drinkability: you could drink a dozen of these without thinking. A great session beer that would satisfy.May 22, 2014"
Meantime London Pale Ale,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,"A: Amber with strings of bubbles. Small off-white head.

S: Floral hops. Citrus. Caramel.

T: Dry, woody and earthy, which I like, but it's quite acidic. Has some of that prickly ginger quality. Fudge and toffee as it warms. Quite strong lemonade in the immediate aftertaste. Admittedly I cracked it open when it was too chilled. As it's warmed it's become a lot more personable. It gets earthier, and nothing turns me on more than earthy beer.

M: Almost creamy. Kind of weird but maybe I'm just being nitpicky.

O: Not bad, just make sure it's closer to room temperature than chilled.Oct 02, 2013"

Meantime London Pale Ale,4.0,3.25,3.5,3.5,"330ml Bottle from Utobeer, Borough Market (£2.50):
Light & clear range tinged amber with a thumb sized, bubbly white head that stays quite well over the opening couple of minutes, only reducing slightly in size.

Light with some grassy hops and a subdued malt base to begin with. There was some light fruity notes in the background but to be honest it smelt a bit basic although still pleasant and most definitely an English pale ale in smell; if only it was stronger in smell. 

A balanced beer with some light malts and a grassy hop taste initially along with some background fruits and a nice bitter finish. This one was a nice and very easy to drink beer but I felt it could have been more in your face and less subdued. There was floral notes and caramel.

Carbonation is about medium to lively with this one and the beer is probably light bodied with a very smooth mouthfeel and only the slightest of citrus tangs to go with a somewhat dry finish. Livelier than usual for the style but much as you would expect.

A nice and well made beer I felt it was a little weak in both taste and smell although things became more pronounced and noticeable the further down the glass. There was a nice floral hop and malt base but to be honest nothing in this beer was strong enough for me and it's not a classic.Apr 23, 2013"

Aroma is espresso beans no surprise there some light chocolate even lighter earthiness hints. Not bad not overly complex not really getting the Russian Emperor reference at 7% but not bad. 

Taste is roasted malts with light chocolate sweetness and good espresso notes. Fairly decent stout wouldn't really put it in Imperial category at 7% otherwise I would be lowering my scores some. Not bad little stout with some earthiness in the finish.

Smell: A faint scent of cocoa nibs, coffee and maybe sea salt. Not a crazy amount going on here.

Taste: Very good. 80 percent dark chocolate, mild coffee notes. The dark chocolate flavor stays for a solid 20 seconds after consuming, delicious. Not sweet or bitter, just a great balance.

Feel: Smooooth and silky. Creamy. Rich. A damn near perfect texture for a stout.

Dark & opaque, bordering on black with a thumb-sized, bubbly beige head that's turns to a patchy surface lacing. It's sweet on the nose, almost like a foreign extra stout that has some vanilla to go with the coffee & darker malts. Dark fruits with an alcohol backing follow whilst the taste is mainly coffee & chocolate with the usual dark malts & sugars too. It was well-carbonated & slightly fizzy with a medium body & semi-sweet finish.Jan 16, 2020"
Hitachino Nest Espresso Stout,3.5,3.5,3.75,4.0,"Filtered, so zero sediment to be concerned about.
L- One of the darkest beers I've seen; held right by a halogen bulb all I get through the black is an occasional thin flash of ultra deep ruby red. Pours with 1Cm deep tan/caramel coloured fine-bubble head. Also notable as one of the darkest heads I've seen.
S- Clear pungent coffee notes together with a some smoke.
T- Coffee, smoke, sooty log ash from a fireplace. Sip2 and boom the coffee soars.
F- The richness is enough to stop the coffee/smoke overpowering. The Feel might be best suited to winter, as a slow-sipping beer.
O- I think you need to enjoy notably strong black coffee to have a chance with this, as it's the big and central focus here. I start the day with a couple of espressos so that flavour is ok for me. [My wife drinks tea, but also has an occasional coffee with milk and sugar and she found the espresso notes way to pungent/blunt for her. To be clear: Her view is not reflected in my ratings.] It's very different, interesting to try and as usual with Hitachino Nest shows exceptional skill in it's recipe and crafting. That said, it's that idiosyncratic I'm not sure I'd buy again due to it's pretty off-the-scale pungent flavour.

Hitachino Nest Espresso Stout,4.0,3.25,3.0,2.5,"Bitter nose and bitter taste. That is how I don't like my coffee stout. But that is exactly what you get here. Burned coffee beans. Regular stout lovers may enjoy it more, but those who prefer Peche Mortel or Founders KBS, will probably not.
Having said that, Hitachino did a relatively good job replicating the style...even if there is no head retention and there is a bit of stickiness. Okay. I seem to be bashing more than giving kudos, so I will just quit at this point.May 04, 2019"

Hitachino Nest Espresso Stout,4.0,3.75,4.0,4.0,"Poured from 11.2oz bottle into glass. Stamped on back label is 'ES.18.04Q'.
Black colored body, with a sliver of a dark brown edge when back lit. Aggressive pour yields a light tan head, which settles down to a thick, creamy cap. Leaves behind a few scattered spots of lacing.
Aroma of dark roasted malts and roasted sweet/sour espresso beans. Traces of chocolate and vanilla.
Front part of the taste profile is sweet malts (including sweet prune), followed by dark roasted espresso beans. Not very bitter, but the espresso lingers. Again there are traces of chocolate but the vanilla is missing.
First impression for mouth feel is rather thin, but the creamy follow through mitigates this. Good carbonation.
I enjoyed this quite a bit, which was a surprise because this is the first Japanese stout I have sampled. Pleasant balance and depth of flavors between the malts and the espresso beans. Certainly the end taste is that of drinking an espresso.Nov 14, 2018"
Hitachino Nest Espresso Stout,4.25,3.5,3.25,3.5,"This was part of a 6 pack sampler that I got for my birthday in 2017.

Pours jet black opaque into my clean back-up snifter (primary is dirty). Huge mocha colored head after pouring rather vigorously. Nice lacing throughout session.

Nose is a mixture of chocolate, and a sherry like sweetness. Oxygen may have snuck into the bottle over time, or it might be old. No bottle date, not sure how old this is.

Taste is a mix of bitter chalky chocolate, and more of a punchy sweetness, that again reminds me of age or oxidation. 

Overall this beer is a little rough around the edges. There a sharpness and sweetness war in my mouth, and it's not a pleasant experience. I'm hoping this was an old or poorly handled bottle, I would not seek this out again.Nov 11, 2018"

Hitachino Nest Espresso Stout,3.25,4.25,3.75,3.75,"This is an espresso stout through and through, but the dominant aromatic note is dark chocolate. Luscious, luxurious dark chocolate, I might add. There are minor twinges of stone and dark fruits, as well as a nice secondary note of the advertised espresso. The aroma in general is nuanced nicely, yet the flavor profile follows nicely. Opening up with notes of toasted bread and faint cherry, it gives way to powerful dark chocolate, caramel, and espresso. Dark cherry touches return on the back end. Not only is it solidly deep, it's also very dry on the palate (the attenuation here is downright superb). It's a bit thin, but it's nicely soft and creamy the same (and at the end of the day, There's also a lot of carbonation, though it doesn't really detract much. This is a damn solid coffee stout, even if the espresso isn't center stage here. It's deeper than the average example while remaining incredibly easygoing.

Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,"I've had this beer in both cans and bottles. The cans I purchased locally in winter '19-20 and found that the taste was negatively effected. It was slightly metallic. While in London at a Young's pub in summer 2019, I had a 500 ml bottle. It was very nice -- smooth, creamy, with chocolate notes.

Smell: Dark chocolate, but so subtle. Maybe the head is holding it in but way to subtle to be appreciated. 

Taste: Watery up front, both dark and milk chocolate, with hints of almond nuttiness. 

This beer is a total enigma. Phenomenal look, disappointing smell, decent taste, and a mouthfeel that starts out weak but picks up some steam in the end. As a big fan of chocolate stouts, this is kind of disappointing. I'd say this beer is far too muted. It earns a B-

Feel: Not much carbonation. Pretty smooth and dry. Would not go on a second date with a man like this.

Taste is all chocolate and luxurious. Hints of that dark fruit show up in the background but chocolate is the overall flavor- not bitter but really smooth.
Mouthfeel is really smooth as expected with nitrogen widget. So creamy and luxurious, but not syrupy. 
Overall, what a satisfying and drinkable beer! I have to admit i always thought this beer would be too syrupy sweet but of course i failed to recognize that Young's knows what they are doing. I can't wait to buy this again.Nov 14, 2020"
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.0,4.25,4.0,4.0,"just gonna do a short review here, very nice chocolate stout here, tonne of chocolate flavour, perfect winter’s night drink, has a nice not overwhelming roasted malt character, hint of sweet dark fruit and a decent bit of coffee flavour, but it’s milk chocolate all the way, smooth and medium bodied, quite drinkable for a milk stout, good stuff.Nov 06, 2020"
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.0,3.75,3.75,3.5,"Poured from the bottle into a nonic pint glass. Color looks black, but held up to light it's coming off as dark brown with a tan head that falls off to a light cap. Aroma is chocolate, roast malt, some black licorice. Smell intensifies as it warms up. Taste is chocolate, a bit of cream, roasted malt, a good bit of sweetness up front and then a bit of bitterness kicks in towards the end. There's a dose of grassy hoppiness in the end. Feel is light and a bit thin for me. This is a well carbonated stout. It finishes very dry. Overall I wish I could get the feel of the nitro version with the taste of the bottle version. This is a beer that gets better as it warms as the chocolate flavor intensifies and the carbonation falls. It's a fine beer though.Oct 17, 2020"
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,3.5,3.75,4.0,3.75,"330ml bottle, best before 'Feb 21'. Poured into a tulip. 
Look: Black, though seemed to be a lighter black. Has about 2cm of tan head that subsides to a film pretty quickly, Leaves a little lacing. Looks alright.
Smell: Roasted malt, a little dark chocolate, some coffee. A touch of sweeter milk chocolate as it warms up a bit. Chocolatey but not as much as I had expected from the label. Pleasant though. 
Taste: More chocolate comes through when tasting. A mix of Cacao nibs and milk chocolate. Like when you make a hot cocoa that isn't sweet enough. Here it is what it say's it is. There is also a bit of roastiness as well, and the finishing bitterness.
Feel: a little thin for a stout, mid bodied. A touch of tingly carbonation at the front of the palate, but not only slight. A dry finish.
Overall: Quite tasty, I was a little underwhelmed. It was good, but I probably went into it with expectations that were not met.Oct 09, 2020"
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.25,4.0,3.75,4.25,"Best by 1/5/21

I have always seen this one at my local since I started going there. It took me a long while ti decide to pick it up as milk stouts are usually not my style, but it was calling me one day and I had to go for it

Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of light brown head that settles to a cap quickly and leaves tons of lacing

The nose is surprisingly balanced; more like a standard stout in its' blend of sweet chocolate, mild coffee roast, and light earthy hops. The malt here reminds me of an amber in the way that it feels toasted

The taste starts with bittersweet dark chocolate, but there's not much else going on. It treads the line between sweet and roasty on the swallow, but the chocolate feels very authentic. A touch of grassy hops in the aftertaste

A medium body pairs with very light carbonation to lead to a fluffy and refreshing stout. Drying in the finish which clears the palate for the next sip

This is an extremely drinkable beer, almost dangerous. I would not frequently get this, but I could absolutely pound a few of these if I'm in the right move. Simple, but very goodSep 11, 2020"

Young's Double Chocolate Stout,5.0,3.5,4.5,4.5,"This is like an alcoholic chocolate milk. The only thing stopping this stout from tasting like a milk stout is how thin it is. Not a complaint, but I think it might be more interesting with a thicker feel.

Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.25,4.0,3.75,3.5,"Nitro can. Deep black opaque appearance topped with a tan, thick, creamy head as expected with a nitro gizmo. Great looking nitro cascade with the pour. The head lasts nearly until the end, leaving strings, spots, and sheets of tan lacing as you drink.

Aroma is chocolate with earthy hops. Semi-sweet malt aroma. Roasted coffee.

Feel is the silky smooth nitro presentation with a thin body.

Taste is dry with chocolate. Some roasted malts. I'd describe it as an Irish Dry Stout with chocolate flavor added. Quite nice, desert rather than dessert. The finish has a slight bitterness, and as at the beginning, dry.

Listed as a sweet/milk stout, but it is not sweet at all. It is a good, but not great, chocolate-flavored dry nitro stout.Jan 01, 2020"
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Eagle Brewery’s Young’s Double Chocolate Stout 5.2% ABV 25 IBU. This milk stout pours a deep dark brown with a cascading khaki colored head that lingers for a very long time before leaving tons of lacing on the glass. The aroma is of faint cocoa powder/chocolate and roasted malt other than that not much is going on. The flavor is muted bittersweet chocolate with hints of coffee dark roasted malt with a slight tang before finishing with a faint bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied creamy but too thin for my liking but it’s your typical nitro beer. This is not the best nitro stout I’ve had but it’s still okay. 5/10Dec 07, 2019"
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,3.75,4.0,4.0,3.75,"From notes 10/1/12: This review is based on the bottled version, not the nitro can. Pours a deep brown (looks black) and produces 1.5 fingers of mocha, short-lived, tightly bubbled head that leaves thin strings of lacing. Nose is dark roasted/burnt malts, semisweet chocolate, a hint of coffee and weak dark fruit. Taste is semisweet chocolate, creamed coffee, light smoke and char. Slightly bitter quality following mid-sip, subdued it increases in the almost watery finish and lingers into the bittersweet aftertaste. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied than expected (almost thin) with low carbonation it is smooth, creamy and goes down easy.

Young's Double Chocolate Stout,3.5,4.25,3.5,3.75,"This beer really remind me the famous ""Fuller's Porter"" that also is from ""England"". This perhaps has little more chocolate and coffe inside but also it is more bitter and has less sweetness inside.. And more carbonation that is good.
The first mouthfeel is slightly bitter that i'm not fan for that but the aftertaste is amazing.. The aftertaste is endless and you feel very good chocolate and coffe taste in your mouth.. Really one of the best aftertaste i have get from one beer..

Honestly don’t think I could tell much of a difference between this beer and actual straight coffee. Very, very smooth and thick. I’m not the biggest fan of coffee but my friends who drink it constantly are sure to love it.Jul 23, 2019"
Coedo Ruri,4.0,3.25,3.0,4.0,"Checked out a new liquor store In Richmond BC that features limited Asian specialties. Saw this and grabbed a couple of bottles. 
Looks great, smell was far from a Pilsner, as I know it, but might have been a shaky shipment. Exp Mar 21 so still good to go by the label. 
Looks nice, has quick head, departs fast, no legs to speak of. Drinking was just a little malty/yeasty/ but no distinct Pilsner flavour. I'll try it again in the new year as it was a little odd, not bad, but deserves a second opinion.Dec 07, 2020"
Coedo Ruri,3.5,4.0,4.25,4.0,"Pours a crystal clear gold with a slightly off white head, which is creamy, and dissipates fairly quick.

Some nice crackery and white bread malt aromas. Lightly herbal and just a touch spicy.

Nice light cracker flavor backed up by a solid spicy and flowery noble hop profile. Very pleasant orange peel note as well. A little bit sweet on the start, and finishes very dry. Just bitter enough to give the beer an excellent balance. Super easy to drink. 

Mouthfeel is just south of medium bodied and carbonation is moderate-high. Alcohol warmth all but unnoticable.

Overall, this is a very nice and easy-drinking Pils with a lot of flavor. Compared to the prices of other craft beers in Japan, this is pretty affordable ($5-$10 is normal for craft here, this goes for between $2-$3, depending on the store). This beer has no ""wow"" factor, but it is solid, reliable, and affordable.Aug 06, 2020"
Coedo Ruri,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.5,"330ml bottle: Decent, above average pilsner with a nice bitter finish. Good but nothing special. Not really a good value considering its craft beer price tagJul 27, 2020"
Coedo Ruri,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.5,"L- Mid-amber, clear, pours with 3mm white head.
S- Toasty malts and grain.
T- Pretty mild, lagerish, finishing with some fleeting richness and a hoppy flourish.
F- 5% and it feels around there. It has decent carbonation so overall has a bit more oomph than you might imagine from an everyday 5% lager.
O- ... though for a beer imported all the way from Japan, as it's lable states: 'Pils, Super-premium Japanese craft beer' it does not seem to me that it has much premium identity that I can pin down. Interesting to try, from a usually more interesting brewery, but not one I'd buy again.

Appearance: medium golden hue with a light haze and a good apparent effervescence. Head is a finger of frothy white foam. I like it, but I expect a lot more clarity from the style.

Smell: lightly malty; relatively clean with a dash of yeasty character. There's not much hop bite in the aroma, but overall it's not too bad for the style.

Taste: a light malt flavor plus just enough hop bite to be interesting. It may not be 100% stylistically accurate, but it is pretty good!

Mouthfeel: medium body with a pretty good carbonation and perfectly decent creaminess.

Coedo Ruri,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.25,"just my second beer from these guys, i think it is grossly underrated here on BA, a really pretty textbook pils, and while i think i wanted it to be a little more interesting, to showcase its japanese heritage a little better, its hard to be critical of a beer like this so crisp and flavorful for the style. its pretty clear, brassy golden in color and shine, and holds over an inch of white head in the frosted pint glass its served to me in. smells like a classic european pils, with the malt doing the majority of the flavoring, more bitterness than expressiveness from the hops, and just a little bit of flavor from the lager yeast. i get some neat earthy minerals that balance a light honey sweet note from the grain, and a zippy fast finish that seems almost impossibly crisp for how much body this has, well above what is customary in the style i think, but it doesnt slow it down at all. this was infinitely refreshing at its coldest, but warmed up really favorably too, the high quality of the brew evident throughout. this checks all the boxes for the style, even if it isnt quite unique as i hoped it would be, cant complain about a lager this good. perfect with oily wood fired pizza! the poor ratings here make no sense at all to me...Dec 30, 2018"

Kagua Rouge,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,"This is one I had a while ago, intrigued by the addition of Sanshō (aka Japanese pepper) – an ingredient I was wholly unaware of until I tried this beer (an enlightening minute of Wikipedia later and I’m buffed with information on this curious spice). I’m a big fan of craft beer crossing cultural boundaries, some of my favourite beers have come from Japan, and a great deal of my favourite beers come from Belgium – just look at my top-100, it’s a who’s who of classic Belgian brews. So when a Japanese brewer like Kagua (otherwise known by the unimaginative and slightly self-conceited name of Nippon Beer Co.) decides to mix an East-meets-West style brew I’m definitely going to give it a go, how could I not?

Poured from a classic 330ml Belgian-style bottle into a Duvel tulip.

A: Cloudy deep bronze body with a pretty dense beige head that leaves light lacing inside the glass. Appearance a bit cloudy given the style, but otherwise this beer looks moreish. 8/10.

S: Yep, that Sanshō has an unmistakable and difficult to describe aroma that stands out loud and clear from first whiff – it’s like a mix between pepper, ginger and clove that really piques my interest as a lover of spice (they say “spice is the spice of life”). Background hints of dark fruit (plum mostly) and a cider apple character mingles with a caramel malt and musty yeast layer. There’s a decent amount of complexity going on here. 8/10.

T: Flavour hits you with a bang of spice – pepper, ginger, clove – right from the off, before bringing in a boozy Christmas cake dark fruit centre, some light caramel malt sweetness drops in, herbal notes towards the finish – which is dry and a touch boozy. Maybe it’s the Sanshō, but the flavour profile comes across a tad prickly, but otherwise this is a tasty drop. 7/10.

M: Medium bodied with a nice dense (though not creamy) texture, yep – ticks all the boxes, could be smoother and less carbonated, but otherwise excellent. 8/10.

D: Totally worth trying this beer just to experience Sanshō for the first time – it’s definitely different to anything I’ve ever tasted before and it numbs the mouth a little (like Kava, but less intense). As far as the beer itself goes – it’s a bit of a marriage of slightly disparate flavours, but thankfully it’s not a marriage that ends in divorce, in fact it gets better as I become more accustomed to the Sanshō character. Not a “10/10 would try again” brew, but then again what is? 8/10.

Food match: Hmmm, this is a tough one… I’m going to say: abura soba with ichi-mi.Nov 18, 2018"
Kagua Rouge,4.0,3.75,3.75,3.75,"As the world continues to shrink, the inspiration of craft in beer making expands. Inspired by Belgian beer making but brewed in Japan, a wonderful amber ale springs to life but with an aura of spice that illuminates from citrusy sansho peppers.

Pouring a rusty amber hue and woven with a hazy, yeasty glow, the beer's frothy sand stained froth applies a rounded scent of toast, caramel, pepper and stone fruit on the noses. Short sweetness of nutty pecan, bread crust and steely caramels lie gently on the early palate.

Yet as the flavors unfold on the middle palate, the soft Belgianesque display comes full circle. A rapidly fading sweetness ensures a moderate fruit flavors of cherry, berry, grape and apple will balance with a light spicy twinge of peppercorn, cinnamon and fennel. Spicy alcohols bring about a spicy rose wine tone to close its taste.

Medium light on the palate, the spicy, dry and irresponsibly drinkable ale springs from the palate with a zip and a zeal of sparkling wine. Tart, crisp and spicy, an antiseptic finish brings about the spicy sansho taste and texture that's both numbing and piquant.Sep 24, 2017"

Aroma: markedly spicy; more intriguing than appealing, at least initially. Hints of lemon and pepper. 

Flavor: Mildly bitter overall with the sweetness of the malts and the bitterness of the hops well balanced. Spicy aftertaste reminiscent of a Belgian rye ale with lemon (not that I've actually had such a beer). 

Body: Full bodied with medium-high carbonation. Smooth.

Overall: bonus points for distinctiveness, presumably tied to the use of sansho. Considerably better than Kagua Blanc.Nov 08, 2016"
Kagua Rouge,4.25,4.0,3.75,3.5,"A: Pours a murky reddish brown in color with light amounts of active visible carbonation along the edges of the glass and some moderate ruby red highlights. The beer has a two finger tall dense foamy beige head that slowly reduces to a thick film covering the entire surface of the beer with a thick ring at the edges of the glass. Significant amounts of lacing are observed.

S: Moderate aromas of yuzu fruit with light aromas of sansho peppers/spicy, dark fruit (plum), and dark malts.

T: Upfront there is a moderate flavor of dark malts with a light to moderate amount of dark fruit (plum) sweetness. That is followed by light to moderate flavors of yuzu citrus and sansho peppers (which only contribute a hint of spiciness). Hints of bitterness in the finish which fades away pretty quickly.

M: Medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Slightly thin, especially for the style.

O: The combination of yuzu fruit and sansho peppers is very interesting and definitely works though this is a bit of a strange example of a BSDA. Enjoyable and I'm glad I tried it but not sure I would go out of my way to find this one again.Dec 11, 2015"
Kagua Rouge,3.75,3.75,4.0,3.75,"Bottle at Kimono Rooftop Beer Garden, Brooklyn, NY

A: The beer is hazy very dark amber in color. It poured with a quarter finger high off white head that consistently left a short head covering the surface.
S: Light aromas of yuzu fruit are present in the nose along with some hints of sansho peppers.
T: The taste follows the smell, having flavors of yuzu fruit and notes of sansho peppers, the latter of which linger into the finish but aren't that spicy.
M: It feels medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation. The sansho peppers lend a slight amount of prickliness to the mouthfeel.
O: This beer tastes nothing like a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, but is very interesting with the mix of yuzu fruit and sansho peppers.

"Lagunitas A Little Sumpin',Sumpin' Ale",4.5,4.25,4.25,4.0,"Indecipherable code on bottom.
Pretty, golden beer, crystal clear with lazy bubbles wafting to the top. A low white head slumps to a persistent film below flecks of sticky lace.
The aroma is beery in an old school way. Up front malt notes of honey and white sugar followed by floral hops along with the green pine cone thing. Hints of cherries and berries and just a touch of citrus. 
Really well balanced between the sweet and bitter in a medium bodied vehicle. Flavors of wild flower honey and lightly kilned grains blend with sharp and tart hop acids lending a crisp lettuce and black pepper character. Smoothly drinable and refreshing, the wheat giving a unique compliment to the firm bitterness.
The finish is long with lingering pepper and alcohol burps.

A: Poured from the 12oz can into a pint glass. The beer is a clear golden color with a slightly off-white head with low retention.

S: Slightly sweet, slightly soapy. Honey, caramel malt, and a solid malt backbone. Hop profile ha light pine and some citrus, but less in-your-face than some IPAs.

T: Balance and a light sweetness are the first impressions. Light citrus and apple. Tastes really fresh and bright. Pineapple tempered by a light bitterness. Malt profile has plenty of sweetness and bread. Smooth and slightly dry.

Langunitas always seem to do a great job on there dates and quality control and did a superb job with this one..I'm getting pineapple/grapefruit, with a slight smack of caramel creaminess to even every thing out..

The smell is nice and hoppy, with pine notes that come through with a slight wheat soaked wood smell that resonates off each sip of this well done American IPA..I'm definitely a fan of Langunitas and this is one of my favorites from them..

Aroma: Pungent overripened spicy grapefruit and sweet orange with very, very slight hints of white bread. Not to undersell the aroma; although it's strong, I'm not getting much else besides grapefruit and orange. A little one dimensional.

Taste: Clean and dry. Bitter pine sap upfront complimented by a gentle sugar cookie flavor. Underlying hints of orange and grapefruit peel. Tropical but very dry. I don't know if it's just my imagination but I'm also getting notes of coffee? It's way in the back on the finish. Obviously not a straight black coffee flavor , more of a latté or cappuccino + cream taste.

There are a ridiculous range of hops here, every note of IPA. Dominantly candied orange ending piney. Rather juicy. Very soft and full. Sweet biscuit, orange scone, and clean lemon finish.

The taste has that wheat smoothness to it that pushes back on the pine notes. The taste is really plain to me. Good yet very simple.

Mouth feel is more toward the medium with the wheat. A bit slick on the back of the throat. Overall easy drinking. Not really picking up much on the ABV. Maybe just a touch of warming in the back of the throat.

I don,t know if this was an old example I picked up at my local grocers mix six deal. Undecipherable date does not help. I really don't see it as a ad beer but more into the good category. I think it would pair well with some bar fare, burgers, wings, pizza and foods of that nature.Nov 21, 2020"

Aroma of lightly grainy biscuit malt, grassy hops and a hint of lemon. Flavor is attenuated biscuit malt with a little husky grain, a hint of caramel, grassy hops. Flavor tuckers out into a bland, grainy and grassy finish. Light to medium bodied with sharp carbonation. If it looks, smells and tastes like a adjunct lager duck, then that what it is. I tend to rate this style higher than the average, mostly because, although I rarely crave one of these, their strength is being mild and inoffensive to the most people, and I find them to be drinkable if unmemorable. This is not one of the better adjunct lagers, and the flavor is simultaneously a little grainy rough and quite muted. This could be partially because, despite the unfortunate ""Fresh"" in the name, this has probably been sitting around for a long time, both in shipping and distribution. I know I've been watching for an opportunity to buy a single bottle for quite a few months (my favorite beer store got quarts of this; I wisely waited for a 12 oz. single). Bland and a bit a rough, a satisfactory, but forgettable adjunct lager, as so many commercial beers are from Asia. A boring, but painless tick of this brewery.May 31, 2018"

S: herbal, grassy hop aroma with a hint of skunkiness. Hint of sweet malt. Interesting, I was expecting a bland aroma, this had a bit more to it than your standard of the style. Nice

T: a bit of sweet corn malt, some rice, quickly followed by hints of herbal hop bitterness. Finishes extremely dry. Pleasantly dry, with no after taste. Watery yet refreshing. Incredibly smooth flavor from start to finish. Reminds me of a hopped up Coors light. Keeping the style in mind, you could do much worse.

F: very crisp mouthfeel. Well done

O: an excellent Asian Adjunct Lager. Better than most of its counterparts. It's unfortunate this beer is getting slammed because many reviewers here tend to compare this to other beers that aren't even in the same category. Yes, this beer may be a 2/5 compared to a Ballast Point, but compared to others of this style it's easily a 4/5. Reviewing against style guidelines is a waste of time.

It wasn't bad, and frankly the flavor went well with the Korean BBQ, and I'd say was nearly perfect. Would I buy it here in the US? Nope. Would I drink it regular if I was in the ROK? Absolutely...if I had some 'beef and leaf' to eat with it.Jun 07, 2014"

Oettinger Super Forte,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Boo, this is so boozy, so poor!
Well, this is not. This is a proper beer.
This is exactly what it claims to be - a strong European lager.
And it’s not even that boozy. I mean, if you had one of these, you know that there are ones out there where the booze kills the whole thing, but here it doesn’t. And it isn’t too carbonated either. It felt kind of smooth to me. And there haven’t been too much malts and it was not too sweet.
See, having read all this information gave me a kind of false preconception prior drinking this beer and I imagined it to be like beers I had in the past - beers that matched the description perfectly.
But it’s not like that at all. It is a decent German lager with a depth and a bit more alcohol than usual. It is close to a bock maybe. I had quite a few beers like this when living in Austria back in the day and they were all good. Need to get the score up a bit higher, people.May 15, 2021"

Clear amber gold in color with thick frothy white head with decent retention, it dissipates to some bubble sheet on the surface and leaves some trace of lacing patch.

The aromas of malty bready sweetness which some part of it is reminiscent of Munich malt. The rest is slight buttery and strong alcohol solvent.

The taste is led by rich sugary sweetness from both bready malt and alcohol. Obvious suggestion of alcohol pokes through in the middle with its spicy and somewhat burnt grain. Hop is quite absence here.

Medium body with not much smooth mouthfeel through the palate from its medium to rather high and lively crisp carbonation, finish is dry.

Strong and too much of booze overpowering the other characters and making the brew out of balance, this one can be skipped.Jan 05, 2017"

Baltika #7 Export,3.75,3.75,4.0,3.5,"Poured from a pint bottle into a snifter glass
Appearance – The beer pours a deep brown color with a one finger head of off-white foam. The head has a decent level of retention, fading over time to leave a small amount of streaky and foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is very strong of a roasted malt mixed with a good deal of caramel sweetness and a little bit of a char aroma. Along with these smells comes some lighter notes of cocoa and a touch of vanilla.
Taste – The taste begins with a very malty roasty taste that has a little bit of a caramel and vanilla sweetness upfront. As the taste advances the roastiness stays very strong, while the sweet fades a bit. At the same time there is a woody and earthy flavor that begin to develop with a touch of a molasses joining in as well recovering a bit of the caramel and vanilla loss. At the very end a hint of alcohol and a decent hit of char hits the taste buds, leaving one with a nice dark and roasty taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is somewhat on the thinner side in terms of thickness and chewiness for a 7.0 % abv porter, with a carbonation level that is rather average. A tad more thickness and a bit less carbonation may have been slightly more appropriate for the style and the roasty/slightly boozy/drier toasted tastes of the brew, but overall rather decent.
Overall – A nice example of a very roasty and somewhat drier finishing porter. Not over the top of chocolate and caramel/molasses like may porters. Quite balanced and easy drinking.May 07, 2020"

Look: very dark brown, almost black. Very small head of off white foam. Quickly dissipating lace.
Smell: Molasses and caramel malt dominate the smell. Slight nuttiness / breadiness in the finish.
Taste: Dominant molasses again, even balance of caramel malt. Very similar to the non-alcoholic beverage Malta Goya, which is brewed with barley and hops like beer, but with a very recognizable caramel flavor profile balanced by molasses. Surprisingly fruity flavors linger, similar to dried apricots.
Feel: light body, medium carbonation, slightly sticky but smooth.

Smells faintly of toasty grain malt, and its a fine smell, just too faint
Tastes very lightly toasty caramel malt and surprisingly dry or hoppy or both, 
plus it's pretty light and carbonated in the feels, making it seem like Heiny brown lager without sweetness = 
overall a very light crisp feeling brown that aint bad but not good enough to get any more

Newcastle Brown Ale,3.75,2.75,3.0,3.5,"Poured brown with one finger white head. Heavy lacing. Nondescript aroma. Bland one dimensional malt flavor. Medium body and carbonation. Not worth the money.Dec 01, 2019"
Newcastle Brown Ale,3.25,3.5,2.75,2.5,"It pours a clear, dark brown body with a small off-white head.

The aroma is mild, with roasted malts, dried fruit, plum, chocolate, toffee and minerals.

It has an earthy but light taste of roasted malts, chocolate and minerals. No bitterness. The aftertaste is watery.

The aroma promises a lot, but the taste doesn't live up to it.Oct 30, 2019"
Newcastle Brown Ale,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,"I don't know much about beer, other than to say that Newcastle Brown Ale USED TO BE my favorite beer. I understand that now it's brewed in Chicago by Lagunitas Brewery, rather than in the Netherlands. So now it tastes like every other brown ale brewed in the U.S. I'll NEVER buy it again. So sad. Please bring back the original formulation, Heineken.Oct 28, 2019"
Newcastle Brown Ale,3.75,3.25,3.25,3.25,"A moderate pour from a 12-oz. bottle creates a finger of light beige creamy foam with long retention. Clear dark amber-brown color with red-amber highlights.

The smell is hop forward with bread, toasted malt and a coffee-like bitterness.

The taste is between semi-sweet and neutral with medium-low bitterness. Caramel and toasted malt are well balanced. Earthy hops with a lager-like attenuation. The finish is quick and clean, the taste drops right off. The aftertaste is short with a mild hop bitterness.

Light body with average carbonation, alcohol is barely noticeable. Light on malt and body yet balanced and true to style. Session-able with no surprises. Light overall character except for the looks.Oct 22, 2019"
Newcastle Brown Ale,4.0,2.25,3.25,3.5,"Hard to tell what you have without reading the back label. Drank first; read 2nd. Brewed in Holland. Weak aroma.

Coedo Shikkoku,3.75,3.75,3.25,4.0,"Served in a Golden Draak Tulip with a busted stem (that balances perfectly on the right angle). 
Quick and evaporating head on this one. 
Nice nutty roasted nut aroma
Bubbly mouthfeel which I like. 
A tiny bit thinner than I was expecting after the rich aroma, but still the best beer I have had from this brewery.

Coedo Shikkoku,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,"30ml bottle - deep roasted smell and flavour of a stout but the mouth feel and carbonation of a lager. Interesting but would likely prefer a good stout or a good lager over this depending on the day.Aug 05, 2020"
Coedo Shikkoku,4.0,3.5,3.75,3.75,"333ml bottle from Beers of Europe (£3.79):
Opaque black with a foamy, tan brown head that's just under 1cm tall & fades after a minute or so. It's quite dark & roasted on the nose without being too strong; hints of coffee & an earthy bitterness follows with burnt notes to finish. The taste is similar, the coffee & earthy malt bitterness lead the way with some hints of chocolate sweetness & a grainy, almost oak taste to finish. The body is semi-dry & fairly smooth, sitting around medium but well-balanced & quite easy to drink too.Jun 03, 2020"
Coedo Shikkoku,4.0,4.0,3.75,3.5,"L- Jet black, zero light gets through the glass, even the edges, when held up right next to a halogen lamp. 5mm pale tan ultra-fine bubble head.
S- Coffee and toasty.
T- Coffee, quite light tasting ABV (blind-tasted I'd guess 4.8%). Nice balance, zero wrong to note.
F- Quite deep, versus refreshing, winter beer. Would go well with food. Rather light feel versus the prominent flavour.
O- Nice flavour, though the relatively low ABV% for the style doesn't bring the body to balance it. I'd love to try say a 6-6.5% version of this, I expect it'd come over very differently and reward better.Feb 11, 2020"

A: Pours a very dark brown almost black color with mahogany highlights, a one to two finger, fluffy brown head, solid retention beyond a cap, and more modest lacing.
S: Aromas of chocolate, molasses, toffee and caramel.
T: More semisweet than semidry. Flavor palate follows the nose. Bitterness light with crisp, clean finish.

Coedo Shikkoku,3.75,4.0,4.0,3.75,"Poured from 330mL bottle into a tulip. Bottled 9/4/17, which is not fresh, per se, but is probably fine for a schwarzbier.

Appearance: rich, very dark-brown hue with a thin layer of tan foam atop. Head doesn't have much staying power, but the color is great.

Smell: nicely malty with a light roast character and some elements of toffee and caramel. I find it quite delightful.

Taste: a light roastiness and good, complex toffee-like flavors really shine through. The flavor is clean and crisp; a great example of a schwarzbier.

Mouthfeel: light body with a good carbonation and decent creaminess.

Skikkoku Looks and Smells like a good copy of this Bavarian style. Its Taste is better than most North American renditions because the hops are more modest. (I know they are in there, but barely discernible.) Feel has modest bubbles. Medium body balanced to the end.Sep 02, 2017"
Coedo Shikkoku,3.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,"333 ml stubby bottle. Pours a dark brown-black in colour with a thin layer of tan froth, retention relatively poor, although the brew is well carbonated. Aromas are dominated by roasted malts mainly, reminds one of a porter or dry Irish stout.Taste is somewhat more complex, in addition to the roasted malts, there are hints of chocolate, mixed in with some sweetness and a creaminess from the carbonation, giving the relatively light body a much fuller mouthfeel.

T: Moderately light malt flavor, clean with a dark chocolate flavor, lightly bitter that lasts through the finish. Clean with a semi-dry finish. 

M: Medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation, pretty smooth. 

O: Pretty solid; the beer has a great dark chocolate character without being burnt and is very smooth and clean. The beer would be even better with a little more expressive malt, but the roast aroma and flavor is very clean. All in all - a very drinkable beer.Apr 30, 2016"
Coedo Shikkoku,3.75,3.75,3.75,4.25,"Lovely example of a black lager. Head soon goes and the nose is earthy. Dark malt with a little coffee comes through and the hop bitterness is present but minimal.Oct 24, 2015"

Coedo Shikkoku,3.25,3.25,3.0,2.75,"Coedo Shikkoku has a thin, cream-colored head, a dark brown appearance, some bubbles clinging to the bottom of the glass, and a bit of lacing left behind. The aroma is of vegetable matter (spinach, celery, beet juice), dark malt, subdued sweetness, and a touch of char. Taste is of all that, with minimal bitterness. Mouthfeel is light and watery, and Coedo Shikkoku finishes wet and soupy. Overall, for a beer with a vegetable soup character, it’s drinkable.

Coedo Shikkoku,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Packaged on: 6/17/14.

Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Thin streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, char, and cocoa aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa, char, and earth flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with solid cocoa and char qualities all around.

Coedo Shikkoku,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Color is a dark chocolate brown, I enjoyed this beer very much, it's my favorite of the 4 coedo's I've tried. It's a rich chocolate, caramel, coffee almond taste is outstanding. no bitter aftertaste, it's a very well balanced beer. I'm still a little intrigued by the price tag of these beers, quite expensive, although this one was worth it.Dec 07, 2013"
Coedo Shikkoku,3.75,4.5,3.75,3.75,"A: Looks flat and oily as it pours out of the bottle. Leaves a bubbly, beige head which dissipates but levels off at one finger. The body is black as coal.

S: Smells great, more like fudge at first, but as it warms I get more coffee and chocolate.

T: Mmm, refreshing. Coffee and a touch of liquorice. It's dry but has a kind of sweet fudge finish which I'm sure comes from the hops. Slightly metallic and papery/cardboard-like. There's a bit of gingery prickliness as it warms. Getting some of that fudge-like hopiness in the aftertaste. Has the restorative properties of an autumn beer.

M: A bit on the oily side. Medium level of fizz.

O: A friendly but mediocre beer, but then it's a mediocre beer style.Oct 11, 2013"
Coedo Shikkoku,4.5,4.0,3.75,3.75,"From the 350 ml. bottle with a little Japanese script on it. Sampled on July 29, 2013.

This pour is a very dark brown to near black color with a head that sits there for a bit but eventually dissolves completely.

The aroma is nice and malty as the style should be with a decent sweetness and maybe molasses but nearly no hop esters. Maybe even some molasses.

The body does have a nice creamy texture but otherwise falls into the medium range.

Like the aroma the taste is sweet and malty with some vague molasses and little to no hop bitterness at the finale. Sweet is the catch word for this one.Jul 29, 2013"
Coedo Shikkoku,3.75,3.5,4.25,3.0,"Bottle bought in Japan, poured into a goblet. 

A: Dark black, slight amber color on the edges. Small head that dissipated quickly. 

S: Roasted malts, coffee, slight hint of citrus and hops. Sweet chocolate is also present. 

T: Starts off sweet and mild. The coffee, bitter chocolate and hop bitterness then packs quite a punch in the middle and it finishes with bitter/burnt chocolate and black coffee. The finish stays in my mouth for a surprisingly long time! 

M: Light, slightly creamy and a little tingle from the hops. 

O: This is quite unique. It seemed like it would be a light easy drinking black lager, but the unexpectedly long and bitter coffee finish was awesome!Jun 01, 2013"
Coedo Shikkoku,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,"¼ finger head and slight ringing start the show, some interesting residual foam that give the beer a ‘marbled’ look along the top like high quality beef. Interestingly, the nose seems to take its cues from this, starting off sweet-yet-musky, smokey and meaty. Quite a lot reminiscent of real barbacue here. The low carbonation and malt flavors create a pleasant, smoky and silky mouth feel. Quite tasty indeed. Slight hop bitterness builds up as you take a few drinks, adding balance to the beer. This beer tastes like barbecue, and I want it with barbecue. Again, another Coedo beer that seemed better than the first time I had it. I suspect it was served too cold when I first had it at the Pub, and I simply didn’t wait for the thing to warm up. I have time for this beer and I’ll be having it again.Dec 23, 2012"

I pick up a 4 pack of Hoegaarden every now and then as I regard this to be one of those ""too much of a good thing"" beers. Personally I'll have one on the odd occasion as it's a quality Weiss which is best enjoyed for what it is instead of a night out kinda beer.
Without going into details, it's a really good Weiss which can be used as a benchmark beer in this category.Jul 20, 2021"

Nice cloudy amber with a nice amount of head that stuck around for a while. Not much lacing. Nice ""full"" mouthfeel with moderate carbonation, not too bubbly. Subtle notes of orange and fall spices.

Served cold on a hot day and you'll be hooked. Great drinkability. (Lot better than the domestic brands that copy that flavor.)Jul 06, 2021"
Original,4.0,5.0,4.5,3.75,"This a mainstream beer, and it's done well. It has what US beers of this style lack entirely at this price point. It's called- class.
If you really hate yourself, you can get a Shocktop at this price, but I doubt you would enjoy it. Yes, some 10$ micro brews achieve the same result , but when I open a 10$ per bottle local brew, I expect it to be better, otherwise what's the point. European beers will still beat any US brews at any time of the week when it comes to flavored line of product. It's in the water, it is simply better water in EU. Food, drinks, even drugs have different taste and feeling in Europe, for those who have been there and done it, it's obvious.Jun 23, 2021"
Original,4.75,4.5,3.5,3.0,"Pours a nice pale ""white"" color with heavy, obscuring haze, but not the kind that clouds many of today's ""NE IPAs."" The head started fluffy white and prevented me from getting a full bottle into the glass in a single try, even on a fairly light pour.

Nose is as expected with banana and an somewhat earthy sorta spice - coriander. There's a little bit of mineral to soapy note like some say of cilantro, but it is missing the herbal aspect of the leafys. Taste brings the mineral water backed by the coriander, with the wheat banana note being a very light platform for these to dance across. A little bit of white pepper joins by mid-taste, and I think it sorta counters and quells an slight increase in banana flavor.

The feel is fairly thin, and there's more carbonation than I expected. There's more heft and smoothness than a seltzer, but my mind did drift to that drink as I tried to figure this beer out. The back end is actually pretty dry.

Lighter overall with a nice aroma the taste (and feel) don't live up to for me.Jun 18, 2021"

Original,3.75,3.25,3.5,3.75,"It's hoegaarden, if you haven't tried one you definitely should but don't expect it to be the best Belgian wheat beer you've ever had. A few decades ago before the craft beer surge this was probably an upper echelon beer, but in the last decade brewing has come a long way and left InBev beers like this in the dust. 

Pours a slightly hazy straw gold. Well carbonated and spritz-y. Traditional flavors of coriander and orange peel are present but muted, probably InBev's doing. Finishes light but watery. Aftertaste doesn't linger long. This is significantly better than comparably priced beers such as Miller or Bluemoon, but that's not saying much. Surprising to see so many 4+ reviews on this, even some perfect 5s. Not to sound overly snooty but anyone reading who would rate this in the 4.5-5.0 range should do themselves a favor and try some real craft beers.Jul 28, 2020"
Original,4.0,3.75,4.0,3.75,"Drank from a massive 750ml bottle. Cream coloured body with fizzy white two finger head that sparkles noisily then settles to a permanent half finger head. Taste of wheat, lemon (as I added a slice of lemon to it) and hint of spices, , touch of clove, very little to no bitterness and is full bodied and hearty but like a lot of wheat beers is slightly bland. Whilst added lemon or lime to lager is a sin, citrus definitely enhances the flavour profile of this beer. Finish is vaguely citrus acid and dry, slightly cloying when drunk quickly but not unpleasantly so. 

It's a pleasant easy drinker and definitely a must try but I'm sure it was a bit tastier 20 years or so ago when it was all the rage with Cardiff metropolitans. You were always disappointed if they ran out of the special Hoegaarden glasses and served it to you in a regular pint glass.

I’ve always loved Heineken lager, but the brown label/bottle on this caught my curiosity, so I tried one. It’s not bitter, in fact it’s balanced very well. Nice toasted malt taste upfront, goes down smooth no unpleasant after taste. Not overly hopped( thank goodness), poured into a frozen mug, it has thin lacing and soft head. Approximately 2 fingers. Great aroma, very pleasant to drink. Will take this one over any craft crap beer!Oct 29, 2017"

S: sweet coffee, dark caramel, and a fair amount of lightly-roasted grain... moderate intensity, inviting... over-arching 'malt' aroma, similar to malta drinks and NA beers

T: light molasses in the aftertaste... pretty dry, despite the sugar-derived flavors... the bitterness seems to come from the high carbonation and roasted elements... vague resemblance to bock... caramel at its core... bit of a grassy bite at the back

F: rounded, medium-full body... pretty dry finish

I can taste much of the same qualities as with the smell, but to a surprisingly lesser extent. This is very enjoyable, but I wish there was more there.


The mouthfeel I'm getting with this brew is clean and crisp. This has zero aftertaste.

Great feel - it is just as good an easy drinking brew as I remembered it to be. If you want an extra delicious dark style, go Doppelbock - this is just meant to be a straightforward, sessionable brew. And if you want the regular Heineken Lager from the store to taste less skunky, go with the can for a fresher taste.

anyway~Heineken Dark is simply an Amazing Beer,an Amazing Lager Beer,it is Roasty and full of Flavor,at first you pick up a nice roasted malt flavor & perhaps some hints of Chocolate & Caramel,and as the Beer warms a bit these flavors become much more pronounced and you can pick up a wee bit of Coffee and just a slight toffee taste also.

Schwarzbier
Kostritzer
Date: May 02 2021
I recently consumed a few of these styles and loved them. I used a nonic, and the temperature is around 44 degrees. The pour created a tan frothy and airy three-fingered head with okay retention. The somewhat slow dissipation left a little lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 22, brown with ruby highlights. The opaque beer allows minimal light, giving of the reddish hue. 

I sense dark roasted malts, toasted bread crust, a tinge of coffee, sweet cereal grains, a touch of herbal, some earthiness, and a hint of chocolate. 

I taste tobacco, dark roasted malts, a skosh of smoke, toasted bread crust, malty sweetness, bittersweet chocolate, lightly roasted malts, a smidge of floral, and earthiness. 

The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. 

The body is medium, low carbonation, and has a fuller finish. 

What a pleasant drinking beer. None of the flavors are too overbearing. The malt and hops mingle well and are balanced. I enjoyed drinking this beer.Oct 05, 2021"
Kostritzer Schwarzbier,4.25,4.0,3.75,3.75,"500ml can into a pint glass. Canned 3/31/21, best by 3/31/22. 5-6 months old.

Looks splendid in the glass. Back body appears deep red when held up to the light. Generous tan head persists throughout leaving spidery lacing.

Good strong malty aroma, a little roasty.

On tasting, a dry earthy bitterness and a measured hand on the roast. Usually this combination doesn't please this palate, but here it works quite well.

Mouth just about reaches medium, finish quite dry with some strength.

A: Chestnut brown pour, nearly black. Great clarity. Beige head retains well at a half inch. Collars of lacing stripe the glass as the liquid level decreases. 

S: Toasty and roasty. Molasses and brown bread. Roasted nuts. Caramel. Bakers chocolate. Grain. Hay and mildly grassy. Clean. 

T: Follows the nose. Toasty grain up front. Bread crust, toffee, caramel, lightly roasted nuts. Richer notes of molasses and brown bread and cocoa powder build middle to end. Sweet grassiness. Hay. Slight grip of hop bitterness and hop spice, like a firm handshake. Nutty and cocoa-like finish.

M: Rich and full. Silky smooth. Stays light enough with only a very slight sense of heft. Well carbonated. Feels like chocolate mousse in the mouth. Excellent.

O: One of only two imported German schwartzbiers I can track down without too much effort (the other being Monschoff). This is my first go of it in a can, and wow does it make a difference. There's actually good hop character! I have yet to come across an American interpretation of the style that can rival this.

It's not often that you see Schwarzbiers around, so I always like to try out the few I can find. Seems to be one of the classic staples of the style so I think it will be a pretty good gauge for others of the style. Let's see what this one is all about

Pours a glowing reddish brown with 2 fingers of tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

The nose on this one is extremely attractive, just hitting all the right notes of bready and sweet without being too sticky. I'm picking up on aromas of toasted brown bread, caramel malt, fig, light smoke, and floral hops

Very light in taste while still being flavorful, this is very good. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting brown bread, black pepper, toffee, and earthy hops. The swallow brings notes of fig, toasted brown bread, caramel malt, and earthy hops

A light medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a very crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry with a subtle earthiness

A great beer right here. It's easy to throw back and quite flavorful. I'll be getting this againMay 16, 2021"

Pours into my Pilsen glass a reddish brown with a great sudsy cream colored head. Held to the light it is crystal clear dark brown with ruby highlights. Head has decent staying power and leaves fluffy lace as it does go. Really a good looking beer.

Scent is caramel and leafy hops. A hint of yeast tang possibly.

Taste is caramel and nuts but there is very little sweetness or that which is present is met with equal dryness/bitterness. As the beer warms dark fruit flavors emerge and the yeast does seem to give a bit of a tang which makes me think of German weizens. Roasted notes. Leafy herbal hops peek out now and again.

Mouth is soft and creamy with a nice drying finish. There is a slight chalkiness.

Kostritzer Schwarzbier,4.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,"Köstritzer certainly looks the part - dark black with off-white head.

The aroma is pretty basic - roasted malts and not much else.

The taste is nice. Nice. Not thrilling, but nice. Straightforward roasted malts, a bit of a burnt toast character, a hint of sweetness balanced with mild bitterness, and a flavour I can only describe as stereotypical lager. The flavour is overall pretty mild.

Overall, it's decent. It'll scratch that black lager itch. But there's a world of wonderful, flavorful, black lagers out there, and compared to those Köstritzer is sorely lacking. I won't turn it down at a party, but I won't be buying it again when there are much tastier black lagers out there such as Bernard or Xingu.Dec 03, 2020"

Overall: This is a terrific Schwarzbier. Medium, almost full-bodied, lot of flavor, low bitterness, easy to drink. Like most German beers, this one pours to a beautiful, thick mousse-like head that lingers. Schwarzbier is one of the most underappreciated dark beers on the plant.

I am thoroughly impressed with Köstrizer's Schwarz beer. The flavors are delicate yet direct, of rich bakery bread and honey and the medium body renders this brew drinkable, not overwhelming the palate. What is great about Schwarz beer is that you can get a deep roasted and chocolate flavor without it being thick and over encumbering. This brew is light and bold, a rare combination.

Smell - Not a big one on the nose this. Not much of anything to smell. But then, that's not unusual for a more mass-market lager.

Taste - Clean. A little malt on the end.

Mouthfeel - This I think is the greatest strength of this lager. The mouthfeel is sharp, not too carbonated and oh, so clean. On mouthfeel alone, I could drink this on a hot day for hours.

Overall - I'm a bit disappointed by this one. I was expecting something a bit more exciting from Meantime.May 31, 2013"
Meantime London Lager,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pale golden color with a short head with low retention. Tasted it at the brewery and unpasteurized. It lagered for 6 weeks.
Aroma of grassy hops. Mild sweet taste balanced with spicy and grassy hops giving a bitter taste.
Light Body with a medium carbonation with small bubbles.
Very refreshing beer, one notch above good mass beers.Dec 06, 2012"
Meantime London Lager,3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,"A clear golden straw colored brew, a white head with small bubbles, little lacing and small curtains.

A weak smell, bread and cereal, lemon peel, a whiff of buttered pop corns.

Tasting of sweetish white bread, lemon juice, peel and some pure bitterness.

Medium low carbonation, small intense bubbles, a fresh feeling, a medium body and a light dry finish.

Clean, tasty and refreshing.May 02, 2012"
Meantime London Lager,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,"Pours straw colored and with a very nice tight white finger head that lasted. Smelled and tasted like most Lagers more going on than a BMC but not enough to make a big deal. Bit of field adn grass and hop bitterness in each. Palate is light and carbonated well but slightly aggressive. Overall it is a decent lager but there are pleanty of better ones (by the same brewer) out there. Overall just a better than Macro lager that I will probably not get again.Jan 15, 2012"
Meantime London Lager,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,"Half pint in the Greenwich Union, Meantime Breweries tap house: Thin white head on a body of bright, clean golden beer, lacing all down the glass as I consumed the refreshing brew after a healthy walk.

Weak nose, like most lager/pilsner/helles beers, some grainy hints maybe, hop floral notes possibly but a great deal of anything.

Clean tasting, with some mini hop bitterness, subdued malt feel towards the end of the taste: nothing that sets it apart from cheaper mass produced UK or other lagers I’ve tasted, OK but that’s all.Oct 31, 2011"
Meantime London Lager,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,"Golden straw colour with good clarity & a two finger sized, bubbly white head that has okay retention.

Light grain, some adjuncts & a little bit of grassy hops along with perhaps a little lemon too.

Well balanced & less harsh with regards to the grain than the nose. There is some good floral hops upfront and a little bit of spice mixed in too

Light, crisp & refreshing offering here that is highly drinkable & overall is very well balanced. The finish isn't all that bitter & there is a nice lingering sweetness to it.

An excellent pale/premium lager that you could drink all night. It has an excellent balance to it & although not bursting with flavour it still has enough to keep you interested.

Meantime London Lager,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,"A 330ml bottle with a BB of June 2012. The label has a trendy hand-drawn panorama of London on the front.

Poured into a Sam Smith's pint glass. A clear golden colour with good carbonation. Forms a small head of white foam that doesn't hang around. Aroma of light grainy malt with a hint of stewed veg/leaves. No hoppy notes to be found.

Tastes of light malt with a faint stewed bitterness. Notes of grain and subtle background citrus, accompanied by a stewed leaf character. Mouthfeel is smooth and tingly, leaving the palate slightly dry. Mild aftertaste of stewed leaves.

Disappointing. I was hopping for a decent aromatic hop character to add floral notes to a light beer, rather than overcooked hop bitterness. The malt is too light to round out the flavour. This is a shade above a macro lager, but that isn't saying much. Spend your money on something else (like Meantime's pilsner).Aug 07, 2011"
Meantime London Lager,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,"30ml bottle purchased from Warners at the Bay and poured into a Redoak globe style glass.

Pours a light golden colour with a bit of haze about it. Nice white head of foam that measured a finger and settled at just above film.

Aroma is initially of grain while some light sweet malt comes through later on. 

Flavour is clean grain with a little bit of toasted malt sweetness that carries it home.

Mouthfeel is solid, as i've come to expect from most Meantime stuff. Not a lot of bitterness in this, but some mouth coating at the end.

Overall a well brewed, clean, solid lager. Not spectacular, but decent enough.Jul 31, 2011"
Meantime London Lager,4.0,2.5,3.5,4.0,"On tap at Taproom 307 in NYC; pours clear yellow color with tons of bubbles racing up the brew and a foamy 2 finger snow white head that faded slowly and leaves great lacing with rings.

Smells of light sweet malt, floral hops, caramel, corn, and grains; a very, very weak nose that has some basic sweetness but that's about it. 

Tastes of sweet malt, brown sugar, floral hops, caramel, herbs or tea, corn, and toasted grains; a nice sweet basic lager that has a hint of hop spices like pepper, cinnamon and brown sugar. 

Mouthfeel is light and crisp, with medium carbonation, a light feel and malty sweet finish that's slightly acidic. Highly drinkable, this is a great session beer.Jul 01, 2011"
Primator Premium Lager,3.25,3.25,3.25,3.25,"It’s a solid beer, with ample carbonation that you’ll want to swish around in your mouth. For the price, it’s one you may find to be on your radar, but as Czech beers go, it wouldn’t be my staple. However, I’d select it over many other lagers around this $ range.Aug 03, 2021"
Primator Premium Lager,3.25,3.25,3.25,3.25,"De color dorado con espuma cremosa de buena retención. De cuerpo ligero y carbonatación media. Aroma a malta y caramelo. En boca es dulce y tiene un leve amargor final.Apr 30, 2021"
Primator Premium Lager,4.25,4.0,4.0,3.75,"Pours a fairly clear light amber with thick, fluffy head.

Smell is crisp and clean with notes of citrus, crackers and hints of butter and popcorn. Quite light.

Taste is bready with crisp citrusy notes mingling with crackery notes of buttered knäckebröd. Solid bitterness, nice and clean.

Mouthfeel is thin to medium, well carbonated.

Overall, a nice, clean lager.Jan 30, 2021"
Queen's Ale Extra Bitter Type,4.25,3.25,2.5,3.25,"Pours two fingers of head on a clear medium straw colored body. Looks good.
The aroma has a mild lemon note to it. Not much but it's there.
The taste has a metallic pine bitter flavor throughout with a grapefruit finish. 
The texture is crisp with moderate carbonation.
It's an attempt at getting some flavor in the beers of Korea, but it doesn't work well.Feb 16, 2014"
Queen's Ale Extra Bitter Type,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.25,"A: Light amber with a nice sustaining head.

S: A pretty good nose of indiscernible fruity hops. Some burned caramel.

T: Bitter like it says on the tin. Quite a bit of cardboard but there's also fudge, lots of artificial solvent-like banana and hints of butterscotch. It's sharp compared to its less bitter counterpart but too bitter to be sessionable. The banana/solvent, while not unpleasant, is totally wrong in an English style bitter. I believe additives are used for flavouring. If it's true then what the fuck!

O: More worthy of critical attention than the Blonde Style but ultimately it's nothing more than a poor Korean immitation beer.Oct 01, 2013"
Aleston Black Ale,3.0,2.5,2.0,1.75,"Relatively cheap at E-Mart at around 1500 KRW. The label advertises it as a Classic British Style Beer -- Aleston -- Black Ale. The industrial Aleston series concoted by OB comes in Brown Ale and Black Ale variants.

The pour of the Black Ale was fizzy with a very short-lived head that vanished in 7 seconds. Colour relatively dark but closer to a brown ale. Strong carbonation dominates the texture. Hints of dark malts i.e. somewhat sweet, very slight hints of roasty, zero espresso, possibly some extra caramel colorant(?). Slight bitterness that lingers. Overall watery despite a 5.0% ABV. Taste is closer in nature to Hite Max (Max is supposedly brewed without rice and is listed as an American Adjunct Lager) with a similar strong carbonation and some additives. Not sure how to classify it, an attempted Porter, Dark Ale, ...? 

Overall disappointing as a ""black ale"", though otherwise still drinkable. However, the competition's near-belgianesque ale, Queen's Ale Extra Bitter by Hite, is a much more pleasant experience of the four ""big"" new Korean beers albeit at about double the price.Apr 15, 2014"
Konig Ludwig Weissbier Hell,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"On tap in France. White head with some lace. Cloudy golden sunset color.

Earthy, zesty, cloves, wheat, spice, lemon and orange citrus. Smooth, soft feel. 

Very enjoyable hefe. Light and easy drinking.Aug 08, 2021"
Konig Ludwig Weissbier Hell,4.25,3.75,3.5,3.75,"11.2 ounce bottle poured into a tulip glass. Best before date of 9/14/21.

L---Cloudy, golden orange color. Fluffy white head had good retention and left excellent lacing. 

S---Orange, banana and wheat are all noticeable. Something vaguely medicinal is present, too.

T--Follows the nose. Orange, banana, wheat and something vaguely off-putting. 

F---Medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. Almost a bit fizzy.

O---In fairness, I had just had a Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier right before this one and that's a legit hard act to follow. But this was still somewhat disappointing.Mar 17, 2021"
Konig Ludwig Weissbier Hell,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.5,"Beautiful white foamy head and light caramel color, with a sweet fruity citrus scent. Welcoming flavor with hints of banana, citrus, and yeast, and a wonderful full body (I think the feel is my favorite part of this beer!). Intensely and wonderfully refreshing; a perfect beer for a warm summer/fall afternoon. Sehr schön!Nov 09, 2020"
Konig Ludwig Weissbier Hell,4.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"A - Clear, golden in color. Throws three fingers of bone white, mousse like head.\

S - Aromas of yeast and wheat lead the charge, before moving into a gentle, refreshing, not quite citrussy tartness,. I get some fruit esters in the center, most notably banana. Fruit center fades into gentle notes of earthy, peppery European hops.

T - Konig Ludwig starts out medium bodied and slightly dry. This moves right into a fruit centered estery middle. As with the nose, I get a little yeast, a little wheat, and flavors of banana giving the flavor profile a little structure. The finish is short and dry, leaving you ready for the next sip.

M - Overall, the mouthfeel is light and refreshing. The yeast and banana notes help keep the beer from being thin and washed out, instead giving a beer that is light and refreshing, with enough flavor to have some genuine character.

I think Konig Ludwig is a very good beer to cut your teeth on if you've never had this style before. It's got all the flavors and aromas a weissbier should have without being overpowering or too intense.Sep 07, 2020"
Konig Ludwig Weissbier Hell,4.5,3.75,3.75,4.25,"Pours a strawy golden color with a stable, medium head.

Smells of milk, sunny weeds and sugar glazed whole grain cookies. 

Wow, this is utmost refreshing with a light body and a perfectly fitting higher amount of carbonation.

Tastes of bread dough, rock sugar and wheat, together with just a light spicy edge to it. Turns very refreshing then, due to an uprising, stony effervescence and a note of salt. Finishes very light, watery, with a lingering caramel sweetness and yeast spiciness.

This is straight forward refreshing, well balanced and simple.Jul 29, 2019"
Konig Ludwig Weissbier Hell,3.75,4.25,3.75,3.75,"Look: Cloudy gold, big white head. 

Smell: Grains, banana, cloves, 

Taste: Sort of a bitter-sweet-sour taste in the mouth, similar to orange or lemon peel. Leaves a more grainy, yeasty aftertaste. 

Feel: Normal carbonation, leaves a refreshing mouthfeel after swallowing.Mar 16, 2019"
Konig Ludwig Weissbier Hell,3.0,2.25,2.75,3.0,"50cl bottle, 3m old.

Clearish gold, standard foam for a weissbier.

Aroma has the standard banana and cloves, but in quite parsimonious terms. A bit of pepper. 

Taste is also quite muffled. Again, the standard weissbier elements are downplayed and it's almost like a blend of a helles and weissbier. 

Overall, a version of weissbier that is ""clean"" and feels like the business strategy has been to produce cheaply, cater to tastes which do not care for individualityor strong tastes, and then bank on the brand and its historic connotations. Meh, say I.Feb 23, 2019"
Konig Ludwig Weissbier Hell,3.0,3.5,2.5,2.0,"With a red yellow body and a fatty but nice foam of fat, scented banana on the freshly sour side with sweet melon and a crisp pepper chunk in the drunk, the full co2 sticks a cup of malt to the mouth walls, various flavors that are out of balance; Not matched or chosen explicitlyJul 27, 2017"
Konig Ludwig Weissbier Hell,4.0,3.25,3.25,3.75,"From a 500ml bottle served at 12 degrees Celsius into a weisen glass.

Look: The beer pours a clear gold with 9cm of dense, white head that settles into a nice cap after 6+ minutes.

Smell: Fruity esters (banana) and spicy phenols (cloves). Grainy and no hops. Lacking some depth.

Taste: Just like the aroma with banana, cloves and a grainy, malty-sweet wheat. Quite tasty. The finish is moderate in length and intensity with a sweet, fruity balance and a faint graininess.

Feel: Medium body with high carbonation. Crisp yet mouth-coating. No apparent alcohol warmth.

Overall: I feel very neutral about this beer across the board. It fits well within the style and has no apparent flaws, however it fails to grab my attention. Probably worth a try if you like the style, but certainly not a stand out brew.Jun 28, 2017"
Konig Ludwig Weissbier Hell,4.0,4.0,3.75,3.75,"L: Gives a cloudy light orange color. A big top of head that disolve very slow. Good lacings on the glass. 

S: yeast, fruits like banana and citrus,spices especially cloves

T&F: starts of with a fruity sweetness, wheat,banana and some small citric notes. In the middle the spices get more dominant and cloves are very noticable.it finish of dry with a small bitterness in the aftertaste. The aftertaste disappear quite fast and sense a little to watery flavour in the end.the mouthfeel are crisp.

O: a good and decent beer but lacks a little flavour to be a topshelf weisbier.easy to drink but a little anonymous.Aug 02, 2016"
Konig Ludwig Weissbier Hell,4.0,3.75,3.75,3.75,"This brew pours a cloudy orange with a fluffy white head, some of which sticks around until the end, lots of lacing and more carbonation than one would expect from a Hefeweizen.
The smell is funky and wheaty with some orange and bananas.
The taste is full of sweet wheat with a bit of a citric acid bite. The orange and banana taste dominate with the finish being slightly dry and giving you a second dose of citric acid bite.
Overall this is a simple, easy to drink Hefeweizen which, according to the label, follows the Reinheitsgebot.Jul 07, 2016"
Konig Ludwig Weissbier Hell,3.75,4.25,4.0,4.0,"This beer pours murky golden in color. It has a solid, thick head to it. You see carbination looking at the beer. The nose is a beautiful wheat smell. The taste is very wheaty, and it feels good going down. A very good weiss.Apr 08, 2016"
Konig Ludwig Weissbier Hell,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.25,"Served cool from 500ml bottle into Weizen glass.

L) Light yellow-orange colour, cloudy, stable dense bright white head. Looks good, if a little pale.

S) Nicely robust clove / ester odour, nothing complicated here, bring on the hefe.

T) Fairly light, citrusy clovey taste. In the lighter half of the hefeweizen spectrum. There is light clove and orange in there.

F) Light and easy drinking, no nasty aftertastes or bitterness. Carbonation is fairly light for a hefeweizen; doesn't have the acidic bite from the fizz. Spot on.

O) Light tasting hefeweizen, this is subtle and high quality. Recommended to weizen aficionados.Mar 19, 2016"
Konig Ludwig Weissbier Hell,3.5,3.0,3.25,3.5,"Pours a hazy gold with a foamy off-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of wheat, yeast, spice, and slight caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with toast, banana, caramel, spice, and yeast flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable, but nothing stands out about this one to me. 

Serving type: bottle.Mar 09, 2016"
Konig Ludwig Weissbier Hell,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,"It pours out of the bottle a nice cloudy honey color with a large frothy white head that lingers and leaves a nice lacing in the glass. It smells of yeast with overtones of nuts and fruits. It tastes even better and for a hefe it will be one of my favorites while in Germany. It has a nice mouth that goes down smoothly. 
A truly wonderful beer.Nov 06, 2015"
Konig Ludwig Weissbier Hell,4.25,4.0,3.75,3.75,"Pours a cloudy straw, golden with a hint of orange. Amazing giant foamy head and good lace retention.
Floral aroma. Hay and straw.
Sweet sugary taste. For me, more malt heavy than wheat . A tiny hint of lemon. Smooth and creamy. Low carbonation but still a bit crisp. Light to medium bodied but feels full in the mouth. Pretty filling like a meal. I liked this one.Jul 24, 2015"
Konig Ludwig Weissbier Hell,4.0,3.75,4.0,3.75,"Had on-tap in Berlin, poured into a tall weiss glass. 

L: Pours a cloudy golden hue with ample head. Generous lacing.

S: Bananas and spices, mild citrus and cloves. 

T/F: Pretty standard weiss. Yeasts and grains.. not an overpowering flavor. Slight citrus and mild banana. Decent carbonation. 

O: Another typical German weiss beer. Decent for hot weather or with a meal. Very clean/crisp with no real negatives.... or positives for that matter.Jun 01, 2015"
Konig Ludwig Weissbier Hell,4.0,3.75,4.25,4.5,"Poured a nice light gold color with a thick white head that lasts a good while and leaves a light residual lacing. Smells of yeast, some clove, banana, citrus, bread. Taste is very light and refreshing with a bit of carbonation. Feel is very smooth and a little bubbly. Great Weissbier with a very easily drinkable, refreshing taste and feel. Great summer beer.Apr 21, 2015"
Konig Ludwig Weissbier Hell,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,"Murky yellowish-orange pour after adding in the sediment from the bottle. Thick, white head, that dissipates pretty quickly. Typical clove and banana but a little subdued. No noticeable hops. Flavor was lacking that sharp, tart, citrus aspect that I love about the style. A little too creamy on the palate. Not a bad hefeweizen, but not up there with the best German versions. It just didn't have that refreshing, effervescent quality.Apr 02, 2015"
Konig Ludwig Weissbier Hell,4.0,3.75,4.0,4.0,"/28/15 (Bottle) - Golden blonde and a strong foam pour and strong carbonation. Nice wheat and citrus aroma.

Konig Ludwig Weissbier Hell,4.0,2.5,3.75,4.0,"The aroma is lightly spicy with a little banana and dough plus a touch of latex and browning apple. The cloudy body is a sunny amber with a white head. The flavor is spicy, sour, and bitter with some waxy, honey-like sweetness; the finish is grainy and mildly sweet. The body is somewhat light but well carbonated and spritzy. 

A little too sour and bitter for my taste, and not well balanced with the more pleasant clove and banana typical of the style. Still, the texture is refreshing and the flavor isn't altogether bad. The aroma isn't too appetizing though.Dec 09, 2014"
Konig Ludwig Weissbier Hell,4.0,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Poured from a 500ml bottle into a weizen glass.

A: yellow, a little bit cloudy, massive head (had to stop mid pour to let it settle before I could finish pouring, and it wasn't at all an aggressive pour), lots of visible carbonation.

S: yeast and pear

T: Mild and sweet, almost like drinking apple juice with a gentle kick. I don't really taste bananas and cloves like I'd expect, but I do taste bubblegum.

F: crisp, slightly chalky.

Very nice.May 09, 2014"
Grimbergen Blonde,3.25,3.75,3.75,4.25,"Has a really nice amber gold color. Good head on the pour. The nose is very sweet. With some sweet corn notes? I think even some apple notes in the smell. The taste is mostly sweet with some hops. On the tip of the tung is all the flowery hops and in the back are the sweet malts. There's a strange after taste that makes me think the offering I'm enjoying is starting to turn. Which would explain the apple notes. It's very smooth though and passes right on down the throat.

Grimbergen Blonde,4.0,4.0,4.25,4.25,"A mild Belgian blond, strong amber color, foamy head, light clove/banana hint in the taste, not overpowered by the alcohol content (it is light afterall... at 6.7). Best poured in an authentic Grimbergen goblet (which I have now). If a strong Belgian is not your style, give this a try.Aug 21, 2019"
Grimbergen Blonde,4.25,4.0,3.75,4.0,"Pours a clear golden color with a dense frothy and lathery layer of head. Great retention with lots of sudsy lacing.
The aroma is somewhat vinous and cider like with notes of white grape and several other fruity esters including pear, peach and green apple. Lightly tart lemon merengue aromas are complimented by spicy phenols, cloves, nutmeg and a hint of white vinegar. Malt aroma evokes pie crust.
The taste opens sweet with an emphasis on bready, pie crust and dry cracker malt and fruity esters. Notes of white grape, green apple, pear, peach, apricot, orange peel and lemony tartness. Little to no hops bitterness, instead there is a light earthy spice and phenols, including notes of pepper and clove. 
Medium to light bodied with a dry finish. The carbonation is moderate and on par.
I thought this was an easy drinking blond ale that had lots of fine Belgian yeast character. I think it’s slightly underrated and should score higher.Mar 25, 2019"

Grimbergen Blonde,4.0,3.25,3.25,3.0,"Capped: Clear dark golden color with moderate activity. Foamy and light creamy white 3 finger head, lasting around 10-15 minutes, with generous legs and decent swirl reaction. Flavors of sweet barley, caramel, wheat, apples, apricot, Belgian yeast, and herbal hops. Slick and oily medium body with a moderate crisp. Medium strength finish, mostly some maillard effect and almost bready, a bit leafy and yeasty, shy fruity feel. Very slightly vinous while more alcoholic, so the freshness is alright. Way too much caramel and not attenuated enough. Lacking some complexity and texture, feels a bit bland and uninteresting. Overall above average quality craft.Sep 05, 2018"

Medium mouth feel. Some spice to slightly sour. Dry.
Solid European Belgian Pale Ale. Pleasant to drink.Jan 08, 2018"
Grimbergen Blonde,3.75,3.75,4.25,4.0,"Pours the same as a left blonde, a clear golden body with a slim single finger head, retention is down to a slim film.

Aroma is a touch on the sour malty side, not offensive, just not inviting.

Taste is good, sweet and smooth, hints of spiced fruits.

Feel is a tad fizzy, but only initially, it goes down well and the 6.7% abv is ideal.

Overall this is a decent beer, ever so slightly edging the leffe blonde (if in fact they are not the same product???)

Grimbergen Blonde,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,"Review: 33cl Brown Bottle of Grimbergen Blonde: ABV: 6.7% 

The appearance was of a clear golden colour with a big frothy white head

Good sized head, with good retention and very good lacing. Not a bad looking beer.

Nice beery smell, very nice. Smells of clove, fruits, Belgian yeast. Smells fantastic in fact. 

Taste is quite strong but not bad, very manageable

Very nice and pleasant creamy mouthfuls. Very quaffable. Like it.
Creamy taste.

Fantastic tasting beer with a lot of nice flavours. Very creamy. Very crisp and refreshing mouthfuls

I like this very much. Easy to drink. Good tasting. Lots of tastes and all well balanced, of sweet malts, of barley, of wheat, of Belgian yeast, citric fruits. Get all the usual tastes working together here, perfectly balanced with both sweet and sour tastes combining well. 

One of those beers after a long day you can relax with, very refreshing, excellent

Grimbergen Blonde,3.75,3.0,3.5,3.0,"Has that yellow color and a little bit of haze going on. The aroma is of a little bit of lemon and bread. Not much.

Taste is light, fruity, mildly bitter. Mild hopping. The bitterness is partly because of the light body the doesn't fully balance out the hops. The yeast is both belgian ale like, and Euro lager like at the same time. 

Its expensive for what it is. Alcohol is relatively pronounced.Oct 13, 2016"
Grimbergen Blonde,4.0,4.0,3.75,4.0,"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a medium golden amber with a fine two finger off-white head with great retention and thick lacing. Gushed just a little bit on opening. Aroma of bready malt with a suggestion on cracker, apple and pear juice, light stone fruit, clove, Belgian yeast; classic Belgian blonde/pale ale. Flavor of bready malt, apple and orange, light stone fruit, clove, thins out into a dry, grassy finish with little lingering flavor. Medium bodied with a pleasant creaminess. The fruit, Belgian yeast and clove are spot-on for the style, but the finish is surprisingly thin, considering the aroma and start. The malt is not as forward as expected from a Belgian blonde, and the BA listing as a pale ale seems right. A sturdy Belgian ale with good flavor, but the finish is a bit light and stark.Jul 22, 2016"
Grimbergen Blonde,4.0,3.5,3.75,3.75,"L: gives of a clear golden color, a small top of head when it pours, the lacings on the glass are good.

S: fruity and sweet aroma on this beer, I sense banana, green apples,honey,spices and pears. It could be more stronger aroma.

T&F: starts of with a fruity and sweet taste, in the middle and finishing 
Hoppy and spicy bitterness, aftertaste is lasting a good time and it have a creamy and comfortable mouthfeel. 

O: the beer is good and enjoyable, but as much other people says is a lot of better belgian examples of this beer type. The beer is good but far from outstanding.Jun 25, 2016"

Nose is quite nose. Not expressive but with a little fruit, malts and a touch of honey.

Palate is good. malt and with some honey sweetness coming through strongly. Not particularly complex though.

Mouth is very nice - very full and creamy.

Overall a nice beer. Says blonde on the bottle although looks like a pale ale. Not a typical Belgian in my experience.

Grimbergen Blonde,4.25,3.5,3.75,3.25,"Served in a Grimbergen Chalice at 'La Boufe Rouge' in Saint-Junien, France.

Appearance: Dark amber, lively carbonation, very clear. Nice head on this that lasts the entire trip with a bit of pleasant lacing. 

Smell: Sweet and spicey, fruity with malt flavours coming through. Slight solvent smell there and plenty of alcohol, typical of the style. 

Taste: Rich and slightly sweet malt with a noticeable spice. Pleasantly clean tasting and full across the palate. Hops come through slightly toward the end and there's alcohol in the nose. Drinking this with a lunchtime meal (Sea Bass & Mussels in creamy white wine sauce) and actually its going down very well indeed. 

Mouth-feel: Medium body, nice carbonation that gives a satisfying mouth-feel across the tongue. 

Overall: A nice beer and went with my meal perfectly. I didn't actually expect to much from this brew so I was pleasantly surprised. Would order again, if it was slightly cheaper (It was €8 a pint!)Feb 10, 2016"

Vinegar, apples, a bit sour, and not in a good way. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall this beer is mediocre at best.Jan 27, 2016"
Grimbergen Blonde,3.25,2.0,2.75,3.5,"French people never seem to be drunk because they have shit beer and always eat stuff when they drink. Is this hypothesis true..?

They serve this stuff everywhere in Paris, as it is owned by Kronenbourg. Fortunately it is far superior...made with barley and wheat...

Fairly lagerish look, quite golden, head stays for a while though quite low, not overtly gaseous.

Quite pleasant aroma, citrussy

Taste is nice actually. Definitely one of the best French beers out there. Personally I am not a fan of wheat beers as it is less easy to digest and feels heavier. It is a bit too smooth, for the flavour it has.

Feel is top notch, as not too gaseous and smooth, the bubbles taste of the beer, not too carbon dioxidey.

France do not have many good beers, which is strange as they are close to Belgium and have more people. This is definitely quite heavy as a blonde, though still fine for a winters or summer day. The inclusion of the wheat gives it a heavier feel, as I think I already said. So good as 1 at a time, not for a long session...

Best served after around half an hour outside the fridge I reckon, on a cold winters night such as now.Jan 03, 2016"
Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.0,4.5,4.5,3.75,"Appearance - Pours an opaque saddle brown with a slight tint of dark amber and burnt orange when held to a light. Little head that disappeared immediately. No lacing left on glass.

Smell - First aromas are chocolate-caramel candy. Noticeable maple syrup sweet smell. Slight nutty and toasted grain scent. No detectable hops.

Taste - Molasses, deeply roasted grain, chocolate cookies are the prominent flavors. Faint nuttiness and herbal or grassy notes were detected. It wasn't nearly as sweet as the aromas led me to believe. While there is a mild sweetness, there is enough bitterness to perfectly balance things. The aftertaste is both sweet and bitter and thankfully it lingers for a while. While the hazelnut flavors are barely there, this brew is still delicious.

Mouthfeel - Body is full and it hangs on the tongue for a while. Visually, the carbonation level looked low but in the mouth its actually moderate. This brew finishes dry and clean. 

Overall - Disclaimer: Like an old man, brown ales are one of my favorite styles. I like malty, slightly sweet, full, dark toasty beer. This one hits the spot. The sweet/bitter ratio is right, it has some complexity (which many brown ales don't), and the after taste is terrific. This review is based off of my first sample of Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar. This won't be the last, though. Very highly recommended.Jul 31, 2021"
Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.0,4.0,2.5,3.5,"L- dark brown, with a light, airy head. Almost like cola when poured except the head is controllable just like any other beer.
S- I could definitely get a lot of hazelnut off the smell. It took a second to hit me, but when it did, it was all I could smell. Didn’t really get much else off of it, the hazelnut was just too strong.
T- Honestly, tasted like they mixed ale with hazelnuts and vanilla extract. Definitely wasn’t my thing. I had thought going in there may be an element of sweetness, maybe some brown sugar, and let me tell you there is NOT. None whatsoever. 
O- Maybe it’s just not my thing, but I will not be picking up another of these any time soon. I have a tongue for stronger, bitter beers, and heavy porters and stouts but this one just tasted dirty. Very bitter, very hazelnut. Not a big fan. Which sucks because I hate putting a beer down, but this just ain’t for me.Jul 23, 2021"
Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.0,4.0,4.25,4.0,"A good English brown ale. Liked the hazelnut & mild bitterness flavors. The ABV mixed well with the complex flavors. Overall, a good start to the style- not too strong or watery.Jul 19, 2021"
Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.0,4.25,4.25,3.75,"Slightly cloudy brown body; fairly thick and dense light khaki hued head. Warm beer wort smell; roasted grain and nutty.

A very nice brown ale overall that combines some nice hazelnut elements to the overall taste and aroma.

It does taste like roasted nuts and has a yeasty bready quality.  

It's thin and has medium carbonation.  The finish is nutty, yeasty and lasts.

It's still fantastic.  Not as extreme as Founders Underground Mountain Brown but far more complex than New Castle.  I give it a 5.4 out of 6.  It still may be my favorite but there are a lot of browns with more going on.May 21, 2021"

Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,"Pours a cola brown with a puffy 1.5"" head that settles relatively quickly to a thick coaster of foam, no lacing. Nose a mix of mildly sweet malt, light cola, earthy noble hops, and a strong hit of ground hazelnuts. Taste is primarily hazelnut as well, backed by subtle sweet malt and floral hops. I found the malts and hops to clash a bit, but the nut flavors elevate the beer overall. Mouthfeel is a little on the thing side but with good crisp carbonation. A good, lower ABV alternative to bigger peanut butter/nut stouts and porters if looking for something nutty.Mar 20, 2021"
Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar,3.5,4.0,4.25,4.0,"Pours a nice caramel color accompanied by a tan 1/2 inch head with good retention.

Taste is very malt forward, subtle amount of baked biscuit roasted flavor, then the nutty flavor from the hazelnut which is really nice, but not overpowering. Medium-bodied, moderate carbonation, smooth finish. Really nice beer, I was stoked that the hazelnut flavor of this brew was subtle & didn't take away from any of the other flavors in this beer.Mar 12, 2021"
Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar,3.75,4.5,4.0,3.75,"Canned 11/12/20

I love hazelnut. I think it's under utilized in beer, as I've run across maybe 2 or 3 of these beers. Anyhow, I knew I couldn't pass up on a hazelnut brown ale. It seems like an oddball style to add hazelnut to, but I guess nut brown ale is a thing so it isn't too far fetched. Let's dive in

Pours a murky brown with ruby highlights and 2 fingers of tan head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

The layering in the nose is pulled off wonderfully, constantly switching between dessert-y and nutty malt. I'm picking up on aromas of dried nuts, creamy hazelnut, milk chocolate, toasty bready malt, earthy hops, and rich toffee

Unfortunately, this loses quite a bit of its charm when translated to the taste, but it's still enjoyable. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dried nutty malt, earthy hops, a touch of dark fruit, and toast. The swallow opens up and sweetens things, bringing notes of rich hazelnut, milk chocolate, raisin, bready malt, caramel, and a touch of astringent hops

A light medium body pairs with gentle tingly carbonation, resulting in a somewhat thin but still flavorful beer. Finishes almost completely dry, with the sweetness offset in the aftertaste

This one was a bit of a rollercoaster. If everything followed the nose, this might be one of the best brown ales I've ever had. But alas, that's not the case. For what it is, though, it's still quite tastyMar 08, 2021"
Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Filtered mahogany appearance with a small tan head and light lacing. Nutty aroma along with notes of chocolate and toffee.

Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.0,3.75,4.0,3.75,"Look: Clear dark red/amber in color with a light tan head that forms quickly and settles fairly quick, leaving good lacing behind
Aroma: Freshly baked brown bread, hazelnuts, caramel, and sweetened cereal grains
Taste: Sweet caramel-dipped hazelnuts and warm bready malt land quick on the tongue and continue to build in strength as grain and bread-driven malt depth joins in throughout. Caramel sweetness subsides some and breadiness and hazelnuts round out the finish
Mouthfeel: Full, medium carbonation, and soft on the finish
Overall: I dig it. As both a brown ale and hazelnut (filbert) fan, this beer always has tasted good to me and is one of my favorites from these folks’ offerings. Not overly sweet and the nutty flavor and aroma doesn’t smell or taste artificial either, both of which would knock it some in my book. Tasty and recommendedDec 31, 2020"

Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.0,4.0,4.25,3.75,"This is a 12oz can poured into a 20oz. weizen glass. This ale started with one finger of dark tan creamy foam that slowly settled back to a thin cap, leaving behind no lacing at all. The ale is a dark cola color with lots of carbonation that is observable when held up to the light.
The aroma is sweet chocolate, the sweetness is noticeable from a distance.
This is good! The start is slightly dry but crisp, notes of roasted coffee, followed by sweet hazel nuts, a touch of cocoa possibly, the finish is slightly dry, a touch of bitters cutting the sweetness perfectly.
The feel is smooth, slightly dry, the carbonation is not a factor.
This is a very enjoyable brown ale. This is the craft brewery of the month at Piggly Wiggly, I may have to stop back in for another six before November is over.Nov 18, 2020"

Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar,5.0,4.0,4.5,4.75,"Pulled the beverage out of the fridge and let it sit on the counter for a few minutes to warm up a little. Poured into a pint glass and a little less head than the other reviewers but still nice tan color and lacing and retention were impressive. Color is an amazing dark brown that is light enough to just barely make out the other side of the glass. Silky mouth feel and lingering nutty taste but an initial toffee response. It smells like a dark roast coffee and malt more than the hazelnut to me but it does have a slightly sweet nutty flavor that balances the darker malts well and doesn't come off sweet as a kid's cereal. Overall, this is an autumn beer and beats cider for the hayride cooler.Oct 30, 2020"
Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.0,4.0,4.25,4.0," month old can into a pint glass. Nice tan head, 2 fingers, that settles slowly into a great crown and full lacing that sticks around. The color is a clear mahogany, nice and rich, with OK carbonation. I get a lot of honey, hazelnut, and earthy malt on the nose. The taste is hop forward, bitter, shifting into some delicious sweet honey and brown malt blended well, ending on a snap and airy hazelnut that is hard to pin down as it finishes on the upper palate. The mouthfeel is fantastic and rich, full and finishing medium-dry.

This is a classic local brown ale, and it has been around for a long time. I do believe they changed the recipe recently, and it isn't my favorite like it used to be, but it is still a fantastic beer nonetheless.Oct 05, 2020"

Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar,3.25,1.5,1.75,4.5,"Definitely an underwhelming experience. I expected this beer to have a sweetness to it, but I couldn't even detect a hint of hazelnut. This beer tastes like any other regular beer, if you're like me and you like your alcoholic beverages to have some sweetness, I'd skip this. The smell also is disappointing, I expected a sweet like aroma but it doesn't smell like what the main ingredient supposedly is. The best thing about this beer is how smooth it is going down, it's nice and crisp, and it's quite refreshing, but again, I wanted sweet and I didn't get that with this beer.Oct 04, 2020"

Creamy nut butter, honey, and vanilla shortbread cookie.

Taste:
Ever wonder what honeysuckle nectar would taste like blended with a creamy hazelnut spread? Here you go. This casually sweet ale presents both those flavors, balanced together by the steady support of subtle, roasty, brown malts.Sep 10, 2020"

Hops don’t poke through much - just solid backbone. Surprising there aren’t many other beers that shoot for this result.

Meantime London Porter,3.0,3.25,3.0,3.0,"Can't remember if corpulent or bonerhog brought this to corpulent's birthday jam in September 2016. Unlike the others around the golf course, this one was at the hotel before the Primus show. 

Pours brown, a lighter brown than your average American porter, although I guess half of those tend to be imperial porters that really blur the already razor thin distinction between a porter and stout, but I digress. Dark red towards the edge, tan head 1/3"". Aroma was also a little different, less roast, more akin to brown ale brown malt feels. Thought there was a chance it was going to be one of those 19th century slightly sour porters, but no. 

The taste went into scotch ale territory, had an earthier, peaty aspect to it, way more bitterness than this malt bill should be handling. What is that, pipe tobacco? Lower carbonation brings on caramel creek where some acorns fall into the watershed through the forest.

Smell - Malts, chocolate, coffee, vanilla

Taste & Mouth - There is a below average amount of carbonation and I can taste malts, chocolate, and coffee. There is also some vanilla and a bit of an odd musty/fishy type of flavour I can't put my finger on.

Smell: Rich malty aroma, minerally, slight licorice, roastiness, some cocoa, molasses and sweet smells in there.

Taste: Lots of flavor from the mixture of dark malts & barley, cold brewed coffee with milk, some toffee sweetness contrasting a bit of licoriceness. There's a molasses syrupness about the beer along with a milky quality. A modest but noticeable hop ending and a slight metallic bite. 

Side note: I've read that this was brewed with 7 different malts and is a blend of different beers, one even fermented with Bretts. I think I read that in 'Amber, Gold and Black' (a book one should definitely check out if interested in the history of English beer) but I'm not sure if the recipe is still the same. 
None the less, a very good porter, and a must try for porter fans. Definitely has a strong malt profile which gives quite a character to this porter. It's not the best, but it's not too miss either.Mar 07, 2014"
Meantime London Porter,4.0,4.25,4.25,4.0,".2oz balsamic vinaigrette bottle poured into an imperial pint glass...

A: Black; light beige, two-finger head; good retention, but not much lace; pretty standard look for a porter.

S: Roasted malt; coffee; chocolate; lightly nutty.

T: A lot of roasted malt flavor; chocolate; lasting coffee bitterness; a hint of smoked malt; some nice sweetness there, too.

M: Lightly acidic; medium-full feel and high carbonation; tangy; maybe a bit too big a feel for a porter, but this one’s a little stronger than average at 6.5%.

O: A really nice porter; I’d definitely have it again; quite drinkable, too.

Meantime London Porter,4.0,4.0,4.25,4.0,"nd time having this. Bottle was given to me by a close friend who grabbed one for me.

11.2 oz dark brown bottle that is stunning in its own right. No real edges to it but just a unique and consistent curve from a fat like bottom to a skinny neck. This is unique to Meantime and more less a bottle you may think to rub rather than open. Lovely and beautiful with its red and platinum label. Very classy. Poured into an English stemmed Port glass.

A - sits black colored on the pour, but the lighting paints a picture of dark chestnut red with shades of brown. Light tan head pours big but quickly fades to a nice ring of lace with a covering that lasts throughout leaving good stick.

S - good roast up front with slightly roasted English malts. Chocolates and a caramel backbone. 

T - coffee bean like up front with a pleasant roasted notes. Semi sweet malt, caramel, with a touch of chocolates and cocoa. A bit of hop presence to the finish paired with a big portion of slightly bitter roasted English malts. Slightly smokey.

M - medium bodied and a good overall feel. Texture isn't great but it does its job. Very flavorful English porter. Easy to drink and enjoyable.

Export Lager,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,"On-tap at the brewery; served in a 10oz straight-sided tulip.

Extremely clear light gold/metallic liquid topped by a lasting ivory collar.

Clean, pure, malt aroma with grassy/earthy noble hop notes and no off notes.

The favor closely follows the nose, the hops (Saaz and Sterling) contributing a lovely low spicy flavor and a lasting gentle bitterness to offset the malt. Perfectly lagered with a slightly mineral, dry, yet malty finish.

Light, brisk, smooth, glassy mouth-feel.

A well made lager brewed with care rather than provided as an afterthought for patrons who cluelessly request ""something light."" Refreshing on this surprisingly hot day...Jun 05, 2012"
Export Lager,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5," oz. growler bought from the brewpub. Poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass.

Appearance: Pours a bright and clear yellowish golden orange with lively rising bubbles and a big four finger white head with good retention. Moderate amount of lace around the glass.

Smell: Crisp and soft aroma of pale malts, wheat grains, and yeast. Somewhat sweet and cracker like. Mild aroma of Saaz hops and grassy hops in the background. Light and subtle aroma but good. Pretty much what you would expect from the style. 

Taste: Sweet biscuit like taste of pale malts, grains, and yeast. Some Saaz hops in the background. Sweet and bready but not cloying. Finishes with just a bit of earthy hop bitterness towards the finish. Light and simple taste but good and fairly balanced. 

Mouthfeel: Light bodied with a moderate level of carbonation. Very crisp, smooth, and refreshing.

Export Lager,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,"on tap at Minneapolis Town Hall -- reviewed from short notes

Thin, light, and easy-drinking. This lager is crisp and refreshing with a mild, approachable flavor.
It is a pretty ""tame"" beer, but every brewpub needs a BMC substitute for the non-craft masses.
I actually find this to be a decent example of the style-- dry biscuity malt with a touch of bitterness.
Light gold body with a white head.
Light body is a bit thin, but I can dig it.

Overall-- not bad.Nov 04, 2011"

T - Taste is the same as the nose, slightly skunked and boring.

M - Ligth bodied with moderate carbonation and fairly crisp.

O - An average dortmunder and average beer. Not anything I'd have again. Dortmunder is kind of a boring style, and even for style this is boring.Jul 24, 2011"

Nose is grainy and sweet with some spicy continental type aroma hops. Bread comes through as well. On taste, sweeter than expected. Has a nice level of bitterness and bready malts, but is just a touch sweet. Well enough made and clean, just perhaps a touch under-attenuated. Medium bodied and mild carbonation throughout. One of the better dortmunders I ever had.Apr 25, 2011"
Export Lager,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"'Bout time I got around to reviewing this sessionable creation. From fresh growler this pours a clear lightened straw gold with lots of carbonation slowly creeping within. A small fluffy white foamy cap sits a top for a bit before slipping aside to a light skim and some sporatic lacing flung about.

Aroma is of musty grasses and grains, oat cereal, English leafy hops, and tender pretzeled bread dough.

Taste is solid and fairly lengthy and tenderly crispy with a bready pretzeled tone mixing with biscuit dough. Sinking musty grassyness and slight medicinal tinting in with its salty pretzel side. Hops are breezed in well with grasses leafyness. Leaves a fairly long impression on the palate.

Solid medium body, clean, round, firm, and bready with a smooth tender snappy tang that's definately drinkable. Much like everything else at Town Hall! Growler gone now and feeling good and feeling full.Mar 30, 2011"

Its great drinking a nice wet refreshing lager on a hot summer day in Minnesota. Beer is light in body and quite smooth and nice. Minimal aftertaste, nice grainy feel to it without bad bitterness from the beer overall and all around. I really enjoy these bigger lagers.

The smell is sweet, not too far off from Grain Belt if you ask me. I get sweet malt, a grassy character, honey and possibly a toasty character that comes more strongly as it warms.

The taste is better, and a little more in depth. Sweet, toasty, earthy, savory, with a nice hop bite. I'm normally not the biggest lager fan, but Town Hall just has that affect on me.

Light bodied, nice carbonation bite that cuts down on the lack of flavor. Good drinkability.

From the Bottle: ""Bier * Biere * Birra * Beer* Bia"".

I Pop!ped the cap & started a slow, gentle C-Line pour into the awaiting glass. This responded by forming just better than a finger of fizzy, foamy, rocky, bone-white had with modest retention, slowly falling away to wisps. Color was a Golden-Amber (SRM = > 5, < 7) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was sweet, but not necessarily from corn as an adjunct. Hmm. Mouthfeel was medium, solid for a Lager. The taste was sweet, but I just was not getting corn. I don't know what they used as extenders/ adjuncts, but I would swear that corn was not among them. Still, it was a bit too sweet for my taste. There was a profound lack of bitterness, despite them listing: ""Ingredients: water, barley malt, cereal, hops"". Hmm. Rice, perhaps? That's a fairly neutral extender. I was baffled, but not off-put as I often am by others in this deeply-flawed style. Finish was semi-sweet, but I just could not identify the adjunct(s).

Anytime I get the opportunity to try a Beer from around the globe, I get excited. Globe trotting Brews are one of the many ways to experience life in another country. Beer is important around the world. It brings us all together at one table, and through food and drink we become much closer. Lets begin with the look. Poured into a tulip glass reveals a bright clear Gold. Nice bubbles and minimum cap. Lacing is good. Swirl test, I get a tad bit of head but nothing much. Moving on to smell. In the nose, I get the typical European Lager smell. More yeasty and Malty than what you expect from a German Pilsner. Soft on the nose. Like many High quality beers, I find that the aroma is not pungent. Now Lets talk about the taste. At first sip, I am in love! On the top Sweet and creamy with a marriage of Rice and Barley Malt. The adjunct plays nicely in this brew. The middle is yeasty and euro malt goodness. Good bit of Body that takes you to the finish. The end is a hint of hops, not spicy like a pilsner. Just a slight clean up. Flavor is simular to many great euro lagers, but has its own character sweetness. Now for Feel. I love the Body this beer has. Its Creamy and silky.

When I go to the Bunny Ranch in Nevada, I know I’m not going to get the best; so when I pop open a Vietnamese lager, one kind of has to take on the same mentality.

Saigon Export,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"It is already quite well known that the American Adjunct Lager is immensely popular in Asia, to such an extent that you will find this as a staple beer in most of the Asian countries, some are better, some are pess impressive.
Now this Saigon Export is actually quite nicely brewed, knows all an American Adjunct should - smooth, refreshing and tasty. No bad aftertaste, no strong corn flavor, almost no bitterness, acceptable amount of carbonation.
I enjoy drinking this far away from Asia or its origin, the US - the beer is consumable enough to stand firm on its own, regardless of its simplicity, cheapness and lack of fame.Sep 17, 2017"
Saigon Export,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,"Review: 355ml Bottle of Saigon Export: ABV: 4.9%

There is some rice in this with a dab of malt, or so they say….. 

On pour, we get a nice clear light golden colour, looks fantastic, bubbling along with some decent carbonation.
A nice decent frothy white head that sticks around, a small bit of lacing. A good looking beer……………

On the nose I get a lovely beery smell, very piercing aroma of the rice but nice, with traces of lemon. Not a bad aroma…….

On taste, actually not much to taste at all, very very watery

A bit hoppy, with a light bitter aftertaste, but its slight

Very watery, did I say how watery it is!

Cant really taste the alcohol…..but on second thoughts I did find some alcohol and tastes of grain in the second bottle….. 

Overall not great, a pretty shit light bodied beer…..and I found it hard to drink it…..its not terrible, just nothing to hold it all together…some flavour or tastes would be nice, instead of water masquerading as a beer………Nov 19, 2016"
Saigon Export,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Clear golden color with white head. Aroma is quite sweet, mostly grainy, even a bit boozy.

Saigon Export,3.0,3.0,3.25,3.0,"Brown glass bottle with red & white label and pry-off crown cap purchased @ Bia Hoi 102 in Ho Chi Minh City for 13000 VND.

4.90% ABV.

Crisp and clean, with a malty taste. Pale malts, some grassiness, some graininess. Plenty of body here; this a surprisingly well-rounded lager. Refreshing.

I find no off-flavours or adjuncts. Frankly, it's surprisingly well balanced and I find myself really enjoying it. Just a solid pleasant drinkable brew that would serve well as a table beer. Depth of flavour is surprisingly good for a lager, and if adjunct was indeed used, they covered it up well.

Unlike many, I don't find it too sweet by any stretch. Yeah, it's simple and one-dimensional, but if we're giving credit where it's due, this is a rather competent brew within its style and may be at the top of my list in terms of preferred Vietnamese lagers from the bigger companies here.

I'm surprised it took me 4 days to come across in Saigon (and almost a month in Vietnam), but I'll keep an eye out for this on future trips to the country. It's not Pasteur Street, but it's probably the best of the cheap Vietnamese brews.

Saigon Export,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.75,"not rating this against all beers, i dont think that would be fair, but against other asia pacific lagers, i think it deserves a little more recognition. ice cold, i think its superior to many of its peers. clear and bubbly, even foamy with the head, and fine retention on it. the nose and taste are fresh to me, none of the stale or oxidized or skunked thing we so often get with these. its a little corny, sweet there in the middle, but its dried out nicely in the finish, seemingly a little more patiently lagered than others. for me though, there really isnt much taste from the lager yeast, and so the beer seems oddly under flavored, even for the style. it is certainly drinkable, as its super light there in the taste, well dry in the end, supremely well carbonated, and really refreshing when its freezing cold. i think its a great companion to spicy fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, anything with basil or lemongrass, all of the pan asian cuisine i think really works here. not necessarily the most distinct beer in the world, but i think its better than its marked here, especially against its peers...Jun 12, 2016"
Bavaria Premium Lager Beer,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,"Sent over by mail in a care package from a friend in Holland this is a decent light tasting lager that has a fresh hop nose and a pleasant hoppy taste. The finish is dry and doesn't hang around too long but at 4.3% ABV you could drink a few of these at a BBQ or party and feel ok.

Bavaria Premium Lager Beer,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.0,"Another Bavaria made beer with a number on it's name, strangely half of the 8.6 series. Anyway, 500 ml can, (and I think is available only in cans) poured into a shaker type glass. Two fingers of whote head, thick for the first seconds, slowly becoming really froathy and going away. leaving heavy lacing around the glass. Average amount of bubbles rising to the top, and lots more of them stuck on the glass's walls. The colour of the beer itself is golden yellow, typical of a euro pale lager.
Not much on the aroma, just malts and some old bread smell.
Taste is kind of weird, maltiness but also kind of sour milk/old bread. Not as bad as I maybe made it sound. Aftertaste is rather sweet too. I see now on the ingredients list that contains wheat too, so that's where the weird smell and taste are coming from.
Watery mouthfeel, and nothing else to report on this front. 
Overall and taking the low price into account, this would do in a very hot day as its tolerable taste and watery mouthfeel make it a very good thirst quencher, but in the Netherlands we rarely, if ever, get very hot days. Maybe something to cook with.Jul 14, 2012"

A mildly hazy light orange with a dense white head with good retention and lacing,this looks solid. The nose is interesting. This isn't a straightforward weizen. It's got cooked clove, mashed bananas and very interestingly, an almost yuzu like citrus note. Noticeably grainy and wheaty with a definite wort character present. The palate opens mildly sweet with wheat, honey, wort and the little citrus I mentioned. Spiced cake with clove and a little nutmeg like character. Unconventional in flavor, this beer is moderately carbonated and finishes dry with a grainy note that lingers. Solid stuff, though it doesn't come close to touching the OGs from Germany.Apr 07, 2019"

Hitachino Nest Weizen,2.75,3.25,2.75,2.75,"BOTTLE: 11.2 fl oz. Brown glass. Branded black pry-off crown cap. Owl on the label in classic Hitachino Nest fashion.

5.50% ABV. Best before: 2016.10. Hefeweizen.

HEAD: 5cm wide. White colour. Frothy. Soft-looking. Leaves no lacing as it recedes, which takes about 2 minutes.

BODY: Turbid hazy orange. Sadly, it`s rather dull. More vibrance would make it more appealing. No yeasty sediment is visible within.

AROMA: Lemony twang, wheat, doughy yeast, coriander, barley. Suggests a spritzy light-bodied ale.

I detect no banana or orange peel.

Aromatic intensity is average.

TASTE & TEXTURE: Fruity, nodding towards faint lychee and some kind of vague tropical citrus (but not the usual orange peel one would expect in a hefeweizen).

Spritzy and light with a toned-down wheat backbone. Not terribly fresh in taste, but not stale either.

Yeast character isn`t as doughy or as subtle as the aroma suggested. It`s a light beer, yes, but it`s also somewhat thin, bordering on watery, and stops short of feeling refreshing. Smooth and wet. Well-carbonated.

OVERALL: The subtle yeast esters and impeccable balance boasted by the best hefeweizen style beers is absent here, replaced by an atraditional fruity character. I like that the brewery is approaching the hefeweizen style in a different way, but the result is not a cut above your average German hefeweizen in terms of quality. It`s not a bad brew by any means, but I`d sooner reach for a Franziskaner, Ayinger, Weihenstephaner, or even Erdinger. This isn`t in the same league by any stretch.

Hitachino Nest Weizen,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,"The loose airiness of the head results in a swift evaporation from the just under one finger level, pure white and spotless, the lacing starts off broadly but lacks meaningful stickiness. Transparent liquid with a fine gauziness, faded yellow gold hue, the bubbles are widely dispersed and show good vigor in flowing upwards. The nose has a confectionery element to it, flower petals, bubblegum, yeast and raw pie dough, honey, banana and clove, the wheat does not enunciate all that clearly, ends with a burst of pepperiness. Medium to full-bodied, more the former but it tends to drag itself slothfully across the palate which adds volume. The carbonation does a good job of starting off prickly and then ending on a creamier note. Here too you get a mix of sweets and bitters, same bubblegum, honey, yeast, whipped cream to banana split flavors and then same cracked wheat, pepper, clove and herbaceous grasses. The fruit seems to alternate, at some moments peach or apricot, others cherry to berry. Has more of a funky aftertaste than clean freshness. Interesting for its slightly off-kilter character but nothing you’d pound all night.Apr 21, 2016"
Hitachino Nest Weizen,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Hazzzhy blonde with a 3 finger head of foam. Sparse lace as is always with a Hefeweizen. 

Hahaha, this is Japan all over. Smell is of jasmine rice, cilantro, bamboo, rain water, celery, and of course white wheat and yeast. 

Flavor of winter wheat, spicy cilantro, already-been-chewed bubble gum, black pepper, sea salt, and leafy greens. Not really reminiscent of Hefeweizen whatsoever, but it has its own thing going on. 

Feel is very carbonated, with a semi dry parch throughout. A little starchy on the finish. 

Hey, I got this for $1.99. I won't lie it's not bad at that price. But for the original price of 5 times that? Ah, I'd be super disappointed. Gotta take that into consideration.Feb 11, 2016"

Pours a hazy honey orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Tiny particles of sediment are seen suspended in the beer after the pour. Smell is of wheat, earth, chalk, and yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with wheat, grain, fruit, earth, and slight spice and yeast flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is fairly decent, but nothing like a traditional hefeweizen in my opinion.

Hitachino Nest Weizen,4.75,4.5,4.5,3.75,"There's some light bubblegum in the aroma along with some clove, vanilla, and a faint twang of lemon and yeasty sourness. The dull yellow body is very cloudy; the eggshell-white head is foamy with good retention; lots of lacing sticks around. There is some rather pronounced bitterness in the initial taste. Also present is some banana, vanilla, and grainy malt. The clove spiciness is restrained but well balanced with the sweeter qualities. Surprisingly not much yeasty sourness. A grainy texture lingers upon swallowing. The body is medium-light with crisp, spritzy carbonation. 

This is a very delicious, refreshing, and well-structured weizen. The bitterness was a little surprising at first, but it helps to balance out the sweeter flavors in place of the thankfully absent yeasty sourness. The carbonation is a bit intense but not bad.Oct 07, 2014"

Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, malt, and light hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of banana, lemon, pear, apple, clove, wheat, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light wheat tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of banana, lemon, pear, apple, clove, wheat, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit.

Widmer Brothers Hefeweizen,4.0,3.5,3.75,4.0,"Poured from 12oz bottle into a tall, straight-sided glass. I can't believe that after all these years, I still haven't reviewed Widmer Hefeweizen! It's a legend!

Appearance: cloudy golden hue with two fingers of frothy ivory foam atop. I think it looks quite good indeed.

Smell: wheaty and malty with a discernible noble hop character to the aroma. Not earth-shattering, but not a bad smelling American take on a hefeweizen.

Taste: wheaty; a little bit sweet, but not at all cloying. There's plenty of bitterness here. It's definitely not a classic German hefeweizen, but it has a nice flavor and just enough bitterness to remain balanced and drinkable.

Mouthfeel: medium-light body with a nice carbonation and a rather creamy mouthfeel.

Overall: I don't get the hate. Yes, they're distributed by A-B and have become a behemoth of the industry in their own right. But this is a tasty beer, and a pioneering beer of American craft. Good stuff!Jul 11, 2021"
Widmer Brothers Hefeweizen,3.0,3.5,3.75,3.5,"As someone very close to the German culture, this will be the first American style hefe I have tried. I am largely familiar with the style itself. Poured from a glass bottle.. wow, packaged 9/26/19- hope it aged well.

L: Hardly a head foams, white and fizzes out instantly. Murky and cloudy about 50%. Noticeably flimsy at 4.9abv and a deep gold, about 8 srm. A very delicate amber.

S: A bubblegum nose with hints of banana and clove swirled in. A background of baked bread present throughout.

T: A citrus shock I did not foresee, absent on the nose, quickly mellowed out by a subtly sweet malt. No significant spices or outstanding flavors, all together long-lasting and balanced, however.

F: No carbonation, thick in the mouth and unfiltered, feeling the particulates on the tongue. Not mouthcoating, as it all washed down easily.

I would say WIdmer makes a good introduction to Hefe, and the best option if there are limited selection. They claim to brew the first ""American Hefe,"" which is great, but the core foundations of any Hefe can be improved upon. For example, The balance of flavors and forward bubblegum was on point, but the mouthfeel could be clingier, heartier. I was pleasantly surprised by the citrus that was not caught on the nose. If one wants to get a cheap German style for an Oktoberfest party, stellar option. If one wants to explore the style in more depth, reroute your resources toward Franziskaner or Ayinger.Nov 12, 2020"

O: This is better than I expected but not as good as the few other hefeweizens I've tasted. This one has more citrus notes but I would not call it hoppy.May 29, 2017"
Widmer Brothers Hefeweizen,4.0,4.0,4.25,3.75,"Nice cloudy gold pour into a pint glass, with a great, robust aroma, full of wheat, malt and citrus. Nice head with noticeable lacing.

Widmer Brothers Hefeweizen,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0," ounce bottle into weizen glass, bottled on 5/17/2016. Pours hazy golden/straw color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of lemon, banana, orange peel, peppercorn, clove, pear, apple, light bubblegum, wheat, cracker, lightly toasted bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, citrus/earthy hops, and moderate pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, banana, orange peel, peppercorn, clove, pear, apple, light bubblegum, wheat, cracker, lightly toasted bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light herbal bitterness and yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, banana, orange peel, peppercorn, clove, wheat, cracker, lightly toasted bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, citrus/earthy hops, and moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitter/spiciness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light dryness from bitter/spiciness, lightly increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy/creamy, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.9%. Overall this is a nice hefeweizen. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, citrus/earthy hops, and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth and refreshing to drink. Very well balanced and nicely flavorful; never feeling bland/watery for the low ABV. Pretty classic feeling style flavors. A nicely enjoyable offering.Mar 04, 2017"
Widmer Brothers Hefeweizen,4.25,4.0,4.25,5.0,"People on here calling this beer a hefeweizen are wrong. It is an American wheat ale aka and American hefeweizen. It is supposed to be different. Anyway it's a flavorful beer that is a cloudy yellow. I'll definitely order more.Feb 17, 2017"
Widmer Brothers Hefeweizen,3.25,3.25,3.25,3.25,"355ml bottle poured into a weizen glass.

Cloudy pale gold straw color, the pour forms up one and a half finger of frothy white head that stays for a while with decent retention then dissipates to some bubble sheet on the surface. There is not much of lace to speak with.

The aroma is rather faint that is led by citrus, floral, as well as some clove spice, wheat grain, earthy, grassy, bready malt, and only ghost-like banana in kind of artificial not that real banana.

The taste is surprisingly not that fruity or bubblegum as it should be with only some citrus, lime, and clove spice. Hop with a bold touch of earthiness, grassiness, and bitterness while malt is also there with its breadiness and subtle sweet caramel.

Light body with some crisp and moderate lively carbonation, semi-smooth mouthfeel with some refreshing touch through the palate, finish is dry.

Forget about the German Hefe before trying this one, it is not that bad but nothing worth to repeat.Feb 17, 2017"

Widmer Brothers Hefeweizen,4.5,2.5,3.25,3.5,"The beer is a darker straw color with a haze that I can still see the fast rising carbonation through. The head was thin and reminded me like a small layer of soap. Very faint, almost no aroma, a slight wheat smell but that is about it. The beer is medium bodied and I do get a nice bubble feel off the carbonation. The beer itself tastes i get a slight spice, not overly strong or distinguishable, not your typical clove or banana flavors. Then a get a sweet wheat flavor.

Widmer Brothers Hefeweizen,3.75,3.25,3.25,3.0,"Nice yellow hazy appearance replete with an almost full inch of white head. Aroma kicked down citrus, lemon and grapefruit.

Taste is almost surprisingly bitter and moreso tart. The wheat and lemon remain continuously perceptible. If you want more lemon than banana in the traditional hefe yeast strains, this might be up your alley. Definitely a hybrid of tradition and American ingenuity here.

Widmer Brothers Hefeweizen,4.5,3.0,3.25,3.75,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Shaker pint glass, there is no ""best by"" date that I can find.

APPEARANCE: pours a dense, hazy, straw color with one-finger white head that slowly dissipated until a thin, unbroken layer of small bubbles remained, there is significant lacing on the glass and medium carbonation (I think?).

SMELL: very faint to the nose, bread and faint banana and lemon citrus note.

TASTE: initially sweet bread and lemon citrus, then faint banana, everything understated.

PALATE: medium body and carbonation.

OVERALL: this is an underwhelming example of a style I truly enjoy, it was a great looking beer but smell and taste were very faint, I would not buy this one again as there are better options available.Apr 30, 2016"
Trappistes Rochefort 6,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.75,"Purchased as a single bottle from The Cellar (Troy) for $5.79. Poured into a pimp chalice.

S - Fig, raisin, plum, and dark breads. A bit of cacao and a dry caramel aroma.
T - Stone fruit and burnt toast at first, then leading into a wonderfully complex fig and lightly-roasted coffee. Caramel is faint but present. Dry cacao throughout. Flavors slowly fade out into a dry raisin, and finish with toffee and walnut. Everything almost hints at sweetness, but it isn't sweet.
F - Thick. Boozy towards the end. Filling. Full body, light carbonation.

Trappistes Rochefort 6,5.0,4.25,4.25,4.5,"Found this dusty on a shelf in my local deli, who knows how long it was there. Probably a really long time from the way it looked and the way the handwritten price was scrawled on a little round sticky on the top of this single. $5.49 it said. Must be a good price for a beer that has a 100/100 rating here. I'm very excited to try it as it's my first Trappist ale. Poured out into a clean snifter, light golden as it poured and darkening as it collected in the bottom of the glass. Nice inch of flaxen head that sticks around in a fluffy layer floating on top. Scent reminds me of banana and raisins predominantly and maybe some orange and grapefruit too. As i swirl the glass, the head foams up again robustly. Upon the first sip, I'm not as terribly impressed as i expected to be. Strong malt backbone, candies of butterscotch and sugary burnt bananas predominate. Also raisins, dates, figs. But it's also somewhat bitter with an earthy, musty type taste to it. Somewhat leathery. The 11% is well hidden and doesn't come through too strongly. Comes with a dry finish. Mouthfeel is full, well rounded, and highly carbonated. Overall it's a pretty good brew, but won't receive my highest marks. It's perhaps that I'm not trying several beers of this style in a row to pick the best. Perhaps my palate is still young and inexperienced. But regardless of what others say, I have to decide for myself. i tend to like big, heavy, thick, dense beers, with robust abvs, and maybe i was expecting the taste of a stout or porter. My only reference for this beer is really Golden Monkey, which I could just as easily pour if I wanted a beer of this style. Glad i tried it as it was quite the experience given the anticipation i had for this beer. However, i'm off to sample something a little heavier.Mar 13, 2021"

Feel: Creamy and medium-bodied. Lightly carbonated and it dissipates quickly.

Trappistes Rochefort 6,4.5,4.5,5.0,5.0,"Absolutely one of the very best beers I've ever had of any style.

Clean and crisp, with many complex subtleties that other have already described better than I could. It does a pretty good job of masking its ABV too, so be careful.

As far as quads go, for me it's either this or St Bernardus Abt 12. I can't decide which is better. Both are brilliant. Those Belgian monks know how to party.Nov 18, 2020"

Trappistes Rochefort 6,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,"Opened a 2 1/4 year bottle that had been in my refrigerator for just about as long.

Pours a dark translucent brown with a fair amount of sediment. Initially the light tan head is tall and fluffy. It subsides to a light ring.

Smells of bread, yeast , brown sugar and raisins. Tastes of yeast, spice and raisins with a slightly bitter finish. The high alcohol level hides very well contributing some heat to the end of each sip.

Medium body and carbonation. Lush mouthfeel but lighter than I would have expected for a beer with such a big character.

This one deserves its World-Class ribbon !Nov 07, 2020"
Trappistes Rochefort 6,4.25,4.0,4.25,4.25,"As is the trend with all the Rocheforts, this has a muddle turbid appearance, with a slightly darker prune juice hue of brick red to brown, under a moderate, less active tan head that's softly convex, settling to a densely blanket that retains well.

Aroma is more subtle and restrained, but also mildly hoppy, while taste follows suit in that it is far more drinkable than 8, despite its slightly stronger ABV. I'm getting notes of sticky toffee pudding with fig and mincemeat via a moderately light but silky body whose carbonation is tingly and fine but expandingly airy, before coming to a semi-dry finish that has a slight prick of numbing heat. A second visit brings a touch of molasses and ginger snaps with hints of caramelized brown sugar, yet it remains slightly bitter by a lightly charred sort of element.

This is a far more balanced brew with a more deft hand and clearly--aside from its strength, which was probably a big deal in its day--this balance is what has kept its reputation so high.Oct 30, 2020"
Trappistes Rochefort 6,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,"This is a wonderful Quad, but the alcohol notes are a bit hot for me. I typically prefer sub 10% beers and have enjoyed 'worse' quads more because there are a bit cooler. Highly recommend for an experience, but not a favorite.Oct 21, 2020"
Trappistes Rochefort 6,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,"Delicious Trappist Ale. Price can't be beat compared to Westvelten. This is a go to beer for Fall / Winter. Cant believe how close this is to the WestV. The lack of a creamy finiah is the real differenceSep 30, 2020"

L: Really, really dark brown, borderline black, hard to see through. Creamy, frosty 1 finger head. Holds nice lacing.

S: The first smell, I get the same kind of characteristics I got from the Rochefort 6 and 8 - caramel, nutty. Although this one is different, there's dates, raisins, some hint of dark cherries singing in the background. A chocolate-rum (sign of some alcohol) cake nods its head and welcomes for a bite. In the distant horizon, a banana, cream kind of flavour shines through, maybe its my imagination?

T: I mean.. the nose was definitely interesting, but the taste blew me away. How this caramel, nutty, honey glazed toffe, banana, nuts, and everything else are so well balancend and easy drinking? From smelling I thought maybe its going to be a bit better than the middle brother, Rochefort 8, but it was really, really good.. Definitely tastes better than it smells.

F: So smooth, very well balanced, medium/high body, creamy nectar. 11.3% ABV? no way..

O: After drinking 6 and 8 from the family, which weren't that special, I expected that this is going to be a bit better, but not this good. Maybe it was the low expectation that took me by surprise, who knows. All in all, this is a special beer, haven't had something this good in a long time..Sep 05, 2020"

Being a Philly Native and before Tom Brady era and before well the whole Boston losing to Flyers in game 7 in 2010, and before the 2003 incident, there was a humble brewery in Boston that wanted to shake the world up by making a beer and telling people, ""this is the beer you want when you grow up a little"" implying that older 27 to 49 year olds were drinking this like a SIR! This beer f!cking blows ass! They use so much hops it ruins the beer. They even showed you on TV how much hops they used and made fun of other breweries for making their beers with little hops. Newsflash! TOO much hops = TOO MUCH ALPHA ACIDS and your beer now tastes like a godawful run of the mill IPA.Sep 18, 2021"

Lager,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,"In lieu of certain recent news, it was time to support the stalwart and review it. A brown twelve ounce bottle has been emptied into a clear pint glass. It's a beautiful bright, shiny and somewhat translucent copper-amber. The head was white and just about perfect for the force of the pour. Much of it endures. This time, a refrigerated beer is being reviewed by me. There's a very pleasant malt-hop combination to smell and it likely would be enhanced were the serving closer to room temperature. The taste is malty without being overly sweet and balanced by some earthy hoppiness. The glass lacing completes a very pretty visual. This drinks so much smoother than any adjunct lager it sometimes gets blamed to be among. Taste is a subjective thing, but it astounds that there are advocates that truly believe Budweiser and the others make a superior lager. Perhaps because with a full malt body and an obvious hop finish, this drinks closer to an ale than a lager. There are good ales lighter in body and taste than this. So, if the heaviness here isn't a lager lover's tea party, it's understandable.Aug 02, 2021"
Lager,4.25,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Poured from a bottle into pint glass on July 24, 2021. There was an ""Enjoy Before"" date of October 2021 on the bottle.

Appearance: Deep amber, with nice thick and light colored head. The head lasted a very long time, and left a nice coating on the inside of the glass.

Smell: Pleasant, with a nice balance of sweet malts and hops bitterness in the aroma. These aromas balance the malt and hops for a nice aroma.

Taste: A nice mix of hops, malts, and herbs in the flavor, that make for an interesting and complex lager, but with a little bit of sweetness. There is a little pepper edge to the flavor. Nice after-taste, that lasts for a while but not too long.

Mouthfeel: Smooth and crisp, with a light body.

Lager,4.25,3.25,4.0,3.75,"Boston Lager pours a light copper hue with a nice white head and a good amount of carbonation. The aroma doesn't have a whole lot going on though. It reminds me faintly of bread with a bit of sweetness. The flavor is better however. The bread really starts to come out while being a bit sweet and having hints of caramel. The finish has a decent amount of bitterness but it isn't terribly dry. Overall this is a pretty good beer.Mar 29, 2021"
Lager,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,"Appearance: Straight from the fridge and into a clear mug, the first thing I noticed is relatively small bubbles in the healthy head. Fairly strong carbonation generates a good amount of fine bubbles in the pale amber liquid. It looks crisp and clear with decent head retention. Overall strong score right off the bat.

Aroma: Malt and caramel dominate on the nose, with an undertone of honey and citrus. Very appealing, can’t wait to dive in.

Taste: Malt and honey hit me first, then the caramel flavours start to move in and the citrus really comes through in the finish. A slight bitter aftertaste in a very pleasing way with the citrus and honey flavours lingering. Fairly well balanced and slightly sweet, but as the IBU indicates, on the strong side for a lager, which I really enjoy and find crisp and refreshing. Excellent and not overpowering; a new favourite.

Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation and a moderately lingering aftertaste. This is the one category where I find this beer to be fairly average; I prefer a but more carbonation and a bit more on the back end.

Overall: This is one of my new favourite beers. I’ll certainly be adding it to my regular rotation and keeping some in the fridge going forward. I like the simple, crisp feeling and the balanced honey and caramel flavours, and it’s got an great amount of bitterness for any occasion.Mar 06, 2021"

Lager,4.0,3.25,3.75,4.0,"""Remastered"" version. ""Enjoy before"" date of March 2021.

Lightly hazy orange-amber, with moderate pale tan head. 

Smells of light caramel , with faint mixed citrus and spiciness. 

Some light floral/fruitiness(halfway? between Pils & helles) , with some of the caramelly malt flavors show through, though less than ""regular"" SABL, finishing with some noble hop spiciness and touch of the malt . A light drying bitterness lingers awhile after finish. In the grapefruit pith vein, but less noticeably so , than when it is warm.

Feel is light-medium, with slight syrupy slickness, and moderate very fine carbonation bite. 

Overall, I'm still on the fence as to which version of SABL I like better, but I do like this. It's just different : a bit hoppier, and less noticeable caramel maltiness. The last few ""regular"" SABLs I had were draft, with dinner, at restaurants (Remember THAT? ;) ) , so maybe that would tilt it towards this, in a bottle-to-bottle comparison? ???

ps : My initial impression , on the first one (below) . Short version : drink them cold/coldish.
[Got side-tracked , & the first one warmed up to 50F? A bit strange . A slightly sour, fruity flavor , somewhere between mixed citrus & dried cherry .That, + a bitter grapefruit pith sensation is lingering at the back of the palate, several minutes afterward.Did get some caramel malt flavor peeking through on the latter half of the glass ]Dec 12, 2020"
Lager,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"The first one is ALWAYS fantastic and just has that distinct Sam flavor and bite. Sorry, this brew truly merits a five.

Piraat,4.5,4.25,4.0,4.25,"Review 1508

My quest to get drink the beers of Fame continues with this beer. The beer is 45 degrees and served in a chalice. The pour created a lovely two-fingered head with excellent retention. The bright white frothy and creamy head left lacing on the glass slowly dissipated. The color is SRM 9, deep golden yellow with amber hues. The clarity of the beer is clear with lots of carbonation within. The beer has a straightforward appearance and on point with this style. 

Initial aromas in the beer are cloves, bananas, bread, and phenolic. Nosing further I detect spicy hops, floral esters, pepper, oranges, subtle funkiness, a bit of damp basement, and toasty malts. 

The flavors in the beer are phenolic, bananas, cloves, bready, floral esters, white pepper, oranges, earthiness, damp basement, toasty malts, and a touch of herbal. 

The mouthfeel is warming and coating. 

The body of the beer is medium-plus, medium carbonation, and a medium-plus finish. 

A tasty Belgium beer, it does show some age on the beer. I do get a touch of cardboard. I bet this beer fresh is killer tasty. Overall a solid example of this style. Great beer with a rounded flavor profile.May 03, 2021"
Piraat,4.25,4.25,4.0,4.0,"Pours a slightly cloudy caramel color. A huge foam head retains for a lengthy period of time, yields lots of lacing. 

The nose opens sweetly with notes of doughy and caramelized malts. Aromas of raisins, figs, honey, melon, grape and a touch of cinnamon like spices.

Opens sweet but with an effective dryness along with balancing peppery spices. Notes of caramel, bread crust, honey biscuit, white raisin, figs, grape, melon dark candi sugar. Notes of cinnamon, nutmeg and peppery spice. Sweet alcohol flavors add warmth and spice. There is an earthy and resiny bitterness throughout. The finish is smooth, semi dry and with some alcohol spice.

Medium to full bodied. The mouthfeel is smooth, fluffy and slightly syrupy, yet it has a dry edge that offsets this a bit. The carbonation is moderate to lively.

This was a very strong Belgian Ale with complex and bold flavors. More of a sipper but I enjoyed it.Apr 16, 2021"

S - Hops, malt, apricot, sour, bready, floral.

T - I've heard boatloads of positives about this one but I'm not impressed. A little syrupy and intense. More or less one note. Floral. With that being said, it's good- just not fantastic.

M - Thick and tarry.

D - Not at all an easy drinker. High ABV and thick. For instance, comparing a high APV Trappist with this is like comparing water to tar. It's more of a meal than a beer. Not impressed.Feb 15, 2021"
Piraat,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"I got a bottle of this beer from my good friend and old neighbor from the 'Wego. It poured a slightly hazy golden with white head that is leaving some lace. The scent had slight Belgian beer twang with some white wine highlights. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with Belgian sweet malt base and anise, coriander and and pepper presence. The mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a solid beer.Feb 13, 2021"
Piraat,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.25,"Appearance:
Transparent, subdued yellow. Within, a raging jet stream of bubbles culminate into a sudsy, white head that’s easily a hand’s breadth deep. Moderate retention with cotton-like lacing that webs all the way to the bottom.

Bouquet:
Belgian spices doused by a big squeeze of lemon juice and topped with crumbles of springy, white bread.

Feel:
A slippery medium whose carbonation is dialed up high enough to feel electrical; crackling across the tip of the tongue, then racing around under it. Concludes on a clipped, tart linger.

Taste:
Apple cider blended with allspice, nutmeg, and tangy pink peppercorn. At the midpoint, a blanket of warming, banana brandy slowly settles over you. After, you’ll drift into a lively dream of tart fruits and acerbic Belgian yeast.

Overall:
Bold without veering off balance.Jan 26, 2021"

11/19/20

Can to tulip glass. One of the 2 beers I used in making a beer cheese for my homemade pretzels. Yum.

LOOK: dark gold color, a hint of haze/sediment, but mostly clear, solid eggshell head; never truly fades, but leaves impressive legs, excellent head retention (since it never really fully left)
AROMA: banana bread, clove, yeast, light hints of corn, pumpkin, nutmeg. 
TASTE: apple-pumpkin-banana-cider, nutmeg, allspice, pepper, some warming brandy flavors. Touch of a sour note at the end, but otherwise very nice. 
FEEL: Medium body, a touch creamy, but that is cut by the sharpness of the yeast and ""cidery/acidic"" notes. 

Very Solid belgian. Not too crazy on the wild yeast, but enough to give it some jazz. 
The yeasty side of the beer cheese. This was the more integral part, but I wanted to get a darker malt mixed in as well.

Hitachino Nest Real Ginger Ale,3.5,3.5,3.75,4.0,"Ruddy amber body. Kind of rusty throughout. Initial swell of wet head dissipates pretty quickly leaving not a thing.

Nose is malty caramels and earthiness. The ginger is kind of an afterthought though it does ultimately kind of remind me of those ginger chew candies.

Sweet and malty is the first impression. Some caramel and roast and a little rye-like spice. The ginger itself is again pretty faint.

The aroma definitely had the spicy effects of ginger up front and a sly little sweetness of it that seemed to come across somewhat like ginger extract - nice to me.
The flavor leaned into the spiciness of the ginger and allowed a stifled sort of sweetness coming in gently. Mild ginger spicy sort of aftertaste.
The mouthfeel was almost medium bodied and had a fairly good sessionability about it. Carbonation felt good and wasn't distracting upon any of the ""ginger-like"" spicy harshness that did show it's presence here but felt good and not distracting. ABV felt on par. Finish was all about the ginger.
Overall, if you don't like ginger, don't drink this beer because that's what this beer is all about. Despite not having any other qualities about it, I would say it's actually quite well done and for a ginger fan such as me, I'd definitely have again.Jan 05, 2018"

Hitachino Nest Real Ginger Ale,4.0,4.0,3.75,3.75,"for how much i like these guys, this one really want my favorite. the balance is off, its overly malty, and there is more sweetness than their should be and i think it interferes with the fresh and spicy nature of all the ginger, which is quite obviously fresh and natural in this cool food beer. who knew it was so strong too?! whew, drank this like a session beer and it caught me! clear red color and very heady in the glass, smells toasted, sweet and earthy, much more substantial then the lighter ales i am used to from this awesome brewery. i like how fresh and floral the ginger is, but the grain is bready and heavy and has a sweetness that i think detracts from the refreshment factor. complex flavors though, strachy, some maple, the very spicy ginger, a bready aspect, and a strange yeast that i cant place at all with everything else going on. lacking some bubbles from the tap, it sits a little heavy for me with my ramen, but it never tastes boozy at all. i think the malt bill could be dialed back a little for a more streamlined and drinkable beer, but i appreciate this one a lot too, nothing quite like it out there. a fine compliment to some spicy kimchi ramen with pork, couldnt think of a better context for this positively unique beer...Jul 28, 2017"
Hitachino Nest Real Ginger Ale,3.5,3.75,4.0,3.5,"Always good to stretch the buds outside their comfort zone.
This Ginger Brew does... and it pushes the envelope just enough to make me think that this is how we should appreciate ale-making experiments. Instead of just piling in the hops, try different spices... like those that are good for you, like ginger.
Without launching into a treatise on ginger, I will keep it short and say it is a stimulant and primarily clears the sinuses.

As for how Hitachino uses ginger, I am unsuspecting in both Look and Smell. But taste immediately tells me ginger is a good idea: first quenching and, then interesting. The Feel is drier than I would expect, since the ginger got my taste glands to go into salivating overdrive.

Hitachino Nest Real Ginger Ale,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,"Thank God I only bought a bottle. Tastes like sugar water with a bit of a twist. The ginger is barely noticeable. My inclination was to dump it after one mouthful but persevered to my detriment and dumped it after three three mouthfuls.Dec 13, 2015"
Hitachino Nest Real Ginger Ale,3.0,4.25,3.75,4.5,"A- This Japanese Ginger Beer pours a dark copper color that is chill hazed. The head starts out promising but becomes non existent fairly quick....just a small ring around the glass! Carbonation appears to be very slow to rise and the lacing is quite minor as well.....not the best looking brew but that doesn't always mean everything.

S- Very sweet, candied ginger aroma overall....a healthy blend of sweet malt, spiced ginger and bittering hop finish. It smells very natural to be honest....I've had some others that smell like theyve been flavored but this one doesn't.

T- This isn't what I expected, flavor wise....the ginger is very much in the background....more like just a tinge to provide warmth. What this really is like is a Pale Ale....malty, rich, honeyed grain and spice, with a finish that is mildly bitter....overall very nice I have to say, if not just a little underwhelming.....well balanced though!

M/O- Heavy mouthfeel for the style, and the carbonation is very mellow.....as this warms, the spice character becomes more noticeable but remains mellow throughout. I think this has aging potential and I'd buy it again, but would like to attempt to put one away.....could be a great addition as a marinade to steak for something different!Oct 15, 2015"

Taste: Follows nose well but much more pronounced caramel malt and floral hop notes. Earthiness and even some light spicy hops along with rich breadiness hold down the middle and finishes with flowers and caramel-slathered bread
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, medium-high carbonation, very clean, surprisingly smooth throughout, and a light tongue-prickling finish
Overall: This is delicious stuff. I hadn’t had one in awhile but this beer helped introduce me to the ESB style many years ago and glad it is still quite enjoyable today. Well balanced hop and malt, along with a great feel come together to make this beer the tasty treat it is.

Nice straightforward nose, with hints of flowers, minty hops, and some citrus and herbal tones. Pour was light, and consistent strong carbonation throughout with a crisp clear apricot color. The body is seems rather thin to me. Taste has an immediate bitter note that pleasantly rounds out with a nice nutty character, with notable malt and some light hop. The lighter notes noticed on the nose reappear after a notable delay, as a pleasant finish.

Although it has a notable medicinal vibe, it's a good refreshing ESB in a region where they are hard to come by. This seems like a nice spring or fall beer to me, although it could be enjoyed year round.May 01, 2020"

For $7.99 a six pack you can't lose with this beer. Tastier than AAL's and many pale Ales. This was also not bitter. You can taste some faint bitterness on the finish, but not overpowering. Very tasty, easy drinker.Jun 20, 2017"
Redhook ESB,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"355ml bottle poured into a pint glass.

Mildly hazed copper amber color, it tops with thick frothy off-white head that stays with pretty good retention before gradually sinking to a bit lasting bubble sheet atop and leaving some lacing patch and spot on the glass-side.

Lots of sweet caramel in a nose together with baked bread, biscuit, and toffee, all from malt. Hop same time provides its crisp spice and mild fruitiness.

The taste is also led by caramel sweetness. Then it is joined in by baked bread, biscuit, and toffee like the aroma while hop lends its mild fruitiness, some spice, and subtle herbal bitterness at the end.

The body is between light to medium with semi-smooth mouthfeel and high carbonation through the palate. The feeling is okay and no offensive.

I have been to numerous pubs in Great Britain and have experienced the taste of pulled from the tap.... what they call bitter. It's cellar temp. with low carbonation and every little town had at least one pub with their own signature homemade bitter. Red hook ESB is the closest thing I have tasted in the USA to the stuff I had in GB. We visited the RH brewery in Seattle and had it fresh on tap. This was in the very early days of the American microbrew revolution, so maybe my memories of that experience were due to the novelty of it.Jan 14, 2017"
Redhook ESB,3.75,3.5,4.0,3.75,"From a 12 oz bottle in a snifter. This fine ale pours a medium dark copper color
with a nice head of white foam that subsides to a thick ring, thin layer, and features 
some nice lacing. Nose of toasted malts and subtle grassy and herbal hop notes. Flavors
follow but exceed with character; smooth toasted malts offset by light herbal hops and a 
medium to light hop bitterness that is perfect to the style. Medium carbonation is lightly
prickly and perfect to keep things lively and crisp with a lightly sweet moderately hoppy
finish that is very nice. Overall, nothing to hate and everything to like for a starter brew.
Just because it is distributed by a macro means little to the overall taste----it is a nice ESB
and one that I used to look forward to enjoying back in the day before they were distributed

Redhook ESB,4.0,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Was glad to see this in 22 oz. at a budget price. In that classic hop/malt balance, which make me love ESB's, this offering is a bit light in the hop element. As a 'malty' ESB it would be near ideal, if that was your desire. I note that many reviews observe a small, quickly dissapating head. The bottle I poured into a Becker pint glass was fairly robust in that department. Doesn't match some of my favorite ESB's (i.e. those served at Brewers Union Local 180 in Oakridge Oregon) - but at the price, I'm fine with it.Apr 14, 2016"

Original Export,4.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,"Tennent’s Lager pours into my glass crystal clear, slightly deeper than the color of ripe hay. The lager throws a two finger, rocky, bone white head that’s in no hurry to go anywhere.
On the nose, Tennent’s presents a pleasantly lagery aroma. Specifically, it starts off bready, sweet, and enticing, if maybe a little straightforward. Sweetness here is more sugars, and less adjunct oriented which in my opinion puts it ahead of most, more adjunct based lagers. Aromas build slightly towards the center, becoming more akin to fresh baked white bread with just the faintest whiff of something sulfury. All these aromas blend together well enough before dropping into a clean, crisp finish.
Taking my first sip, I’m greeted by a soft, smooth, rounded mouthfeel. Flavors of sweetness and fresh baked bread much like what I found in the nose. Center builds a little, giving me a very rounded mouthfeel. Rounded center seems to add to the overall refreshing quality of the beer which is something I look for in a lager. Slight sulfur quality seems more prominent on the tongue, skewing the overall flavor profile in a direction I like less than I did when discussing the beer’s aroma. Either way, it drops into a rounded finish that is overall at least decently satisfying.Oct 21, 2020"

T: Semisweet. Flavors of grainy malt, cocoa, biscuit/cookie, honey, and cocoa. Light, light bitterness achieving just the right balance.

Original Export,4.0,3.25,3.0,3.5,"0ml can, another hard to pin down sideshow from the 'original' Tennent's offering pushed onto we North Americans more than a few years ago, now, yeeeeh?

This beer pours a clear, bright pale (I know) golden yellow colour, with two fingers of puffy, yet broadly foamy, and generally fizzy dirty white head, which leaves some stellar Bonsai tree forest lace around the glass as it evenly subsides.

It smells of semi-sweet grainy, bready, and corny malt, a touch of less than tethered generic booziness, unloved yeast, and very weak earthy, dead leafy, and musty 'noble' hops. The taste is fairly replete with a sugary, bready and plainly grainy pale and corny malt sweetness, sidling yeast, stale apple and pear fruity measures, and more stupidly weak weedy, leafy, and morbidly floral so-called hop bitters.

The carbonation is damned-near nonexistent for this or any other style after that initial outburst, the body a so-so medium weight, and marketing committee smooth - yeah, but, well, y'know, not so much. It finishes too damned sweet, grainy, and hardly something that my palate might want to further pursue.

Overall, this is yer typical cheap-ass, hard to really get into swill from someone's local macro brewing concern - the stuff you slam before doing the same to your 'opponents' in the stands of your local derby, or whatever the hell it's called over there.Feb 11, 2016"

Smell - plenty of grain, lots of bready and biscuit aromas more so than usual for an euro pale lager. Slight fusel alcohol aroma within.

Taste- mild bready flavoured lager, light graininess throughout. A bit of a sweet malty backbone.

It pours pale yellow to golden with a very large white foamy head that never really settles back. 

Aroma of malts, slightly sweet, rice maybe, and clean grassy hops.

Light to medium body. 

The taste is a bit of a rebound over the bland aroma. I do pick up a modest toasted malt character. toffee, and a finish that is mild. A good beer to drink with a hearty pub meal. Maybe stew.Jan 19, 2015"
Original Export,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.25,"00 mL can from the LCBO, best before May 31 2015. First reviewed back in 2011, although it was submitted under the wrong Tennent's Lager (to be fair, this entry didn't exist yet). Rather than copy the old review here, I'm just going to delete it and give this one a do-over. Served slightly chilled.

Pours a bright, clear golden-yellow colour; a slightly deeper hue than many pale lagers. It's topped with over one finger of soapy white froth, which recedes quickly over the next minute or two, eventually leaving behind a thin collar and film. No lace. The aroma consists of pretty typical Euro lager smells - grainy barley malts, grassy hops, and some corny notes. Neither off-putting nor enticing, really. 

The flavour holds up similarly - pale malt sweetness, a little bready but mostly just grainy. Mildly grassy, with a hint of lemon zest toward the finish. This is a fairly clean-tasting lager, with no real strong or weak points. Light-bodied, with carbonation appropriate for the style that provides a crisp, refreshing mouthfeel. 

Final Grade: 3.36, a B-. Tennent's Export Lager is a forgettable beer, but as far as Euro lagers go there is nothing inherently wrong with it. The price is reasonable, and it tastes as good as any of the 'big name' Euro lagers - though I'd still take any number of pilseners over this particular brew. This is obviously not the epitome of Scottish lager brewing, but it's passable for the style, and worth a try.Aug 07, 2014"
Original Export,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.5,"Poured from the can into a becker pint glass.

Deep brass gold with thin carbonation and a very tall bone white soapy head. Three fingers tall and keeps a thin white puck while drinking.

Some sticky lager yeast and kind of fruity a little bit. Some corn like sweetness it seems and macro like aromas.

Mild sweetness and some almost estery fruit qualities. Mild white bread toast finish a bit with common macro lager sweetness. Slightly sticky but not too syrupy but corn like sweetness is noticeable it seems. Slightly wet bodied but the sweetness and somewhat syrupy malt bill gives some depth to match

Minimal bubbles & lacing (reminds me of when the hot tub turns off, less the Unidentfied Floating Objects). The smell is pleasantly sour with a bit of jute undertones, but the taste is mild & low carbonated. Creamed corn comes to mind as its subtle sweetness settles in (try & say that 5 times fast). Would it be safe to say this is a nice ""ladies beer""? I'll call it ""Tina"". My mouthfeels like it wants more, so that is good. Not prickly at all, despite the jute.

I was the guest co-speaker/lecturer for the PGH Cultural Trust's monthly Beer School, run by Tony Knipling of Vecenie Distributing in Millvale and this month's Summer School focus was on CANs!

The Crack & Glug were flawless and I ended up with two fingers of dense, bone-white head with excellent retention. Once again, I was reminded of meringue. Color was a pretty sunshine-yellow with NE-plus quality clarity, allowing me to see into the future. 28 Feb 2015, to be precise, in Lincoln, NE for a joint birthday celebration with Val MidWest (her 21st and my 50th). Nose was slightly off - yes, it was grassy, but there was a phenolic cast to it, like Band-Aids. Mouthfeel was medium and the nose did not translate to the taste, thankfully. It had the characteristic honey-like sweetness of lager along with a grassy Noble hoppiness. Finish was clean, unobtrusive, and frankly, quite tasty. It was semi-dry and refreshing with the hops really dominating at the end. I hate to come off as jaded, but I have had so many CANned lagers that it becomes difficult to distinguish one from another. For this reason, I CANnot recommend making an effort to find this one, although there was nothing intrinsically wrong with it.Jun 21, 2013"

Original Export,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,"Served in a Hoegaarden glass at Independence Tap.

Ducked in for a drink to wait for my ride, figured I'd give this guy a second try. It pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger or so of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises light grass, funky wheat, and light corn. The taste brings in more of the same, though comes across as cleaner, less-adjunct-y somehow. (And, yes, I'm using ""adjunct"" in its pejorative sense...) The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a relatively smooth feel. Overall, a generic-feeling Euro pale lager, but one I for some reason imagine being better on cask (or even nitro-can).Oct 15, 2012"
Original Export,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,"Poured this into a 6oz hotel glass, and the brew makes a finger thick white foam crown, and the body is pale gold and cleanly filtered.

Tastewise, it's muted with cereal grain and slight lemon. 

Feels thin and wetting to the palate.Sep 14, 2012"
Original Export,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,"Can: a pretty crappy and standard looking 500mL can.

Appearance: pours a clear, standard yellow body with an expansive, white foamy head. Not hugely enticing.

Aroma: lightly sweet-scented pale malts with some graininess and a touch of floral hops.

Taste: silky smooth pale malt flavours, with grains and light citrus. Nice for a macro lager.

Aftertaste: dissipates quite quickly, as most lagers do. Still a touch of those floral hops though.

Mouth feel: fairly creamy, particularly for a lager. Low-to-moderate carbonation.

Overall: fairly sophisticated blend of pale biscuit malts, floral hops and a reasonable amount of typical lager grains. Bloody good price for an English beer (even though only a lager). AU$80 (2012) for 24 x 500mL, which equates to around AU$55 a case for a normal case of 24 x 330mL.Jul 02, 2012"
Original Export,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,"Very light coloured straw with tonne of bubbles rising to the surface and a foamy white head that is about an inch tall and stays relatively well.

Bland smelling but with a skunk aroma lingering in the background. There is some corn, vegetable adjuncts, some bread and very light malts along with some grain.

Corn, bread and very basic malts make up most of the taste along with some grain and skunk flavours. Again it is quite bland though and not very appealing.

Thin bodied and quite watery, at least that makes it smooth though I guess. There is mild carbonation and a background sweetness with a mildly bitter finish.

A very basic pale lager and not one I pale to try again, it was drinkable but only just. The only thing noteworthy about it is that I would probably rate it worse than I would normal Tennent's Lager.

A: Pours a crystal clear golden yellow with significant visible carbonation. The beer has a two finger tall white head that show great retention with the majority of it lasting through the entire beer. There is very serious significant lacing observed.

S: Very light skunkiness to the overall aroma but that is over the top of bready malts and some light citrus hops.

T: I pleasant malty start to the beer with hints of pale and bready malts. There is a very nice bitterness in the finish from the light citrusy hops.

M: Just shy of medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Slightly creamy.

Fruh Kolsch,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Very pale, crystal clear, light straw colour with a huge head despite a gentle pour. Carbonation going absolutely bonkers. Resembles champagne or pear cider. Based on appearance one would assume it's a light lager. This is a very pretty beer. Enormous biscuit malts dominate both the nose and the taste, but on the tongue they give way to gentle floral hops in the finish. There is also a slight tinge of sourness throughout, just an undercurrent really, adding another dimension of flavour. That's about all that's going on flavour wise, but sometimes less is more. My only gripe with the flavour is it hangs around the middle of the tongue, feeling a bit thin, and short lasting. It goes down very easily, supremely quaffable. A great refresher for a hot day.

The taste is semisweet fresh juicy apple & pear over a pale malt background with minimal grassy / floral hop bitterness.

Overall: Another precision German beer. Enjoyable to drink. Surprisingly moderate to full bodied despite the crystal clear appearance. Beautiful visually in a tall Stange glass.

Fruh Kolsch,3.75,4.0,4.25,4.5,"Brauerei Früh am Dom ""Früh Kölsch""
330 ml browng lass bottle, coded ""7819 2170715""
$1.99 @ Roger Wilco, Pennsauken, NJ

Notes via stream of consciousness: I'm a little surprised that I haven't already reviewed the Früh Kölsch because it used to be the easiest Kölsch for me to get. It wasn't my favorite, but it was always in stock at the beer distributor which made it easy. It's poured a straw gold body with fingerprints-through-the-glass clarity beneath a full-sized head of white foam. The aroma is delicately spicy and herbal alongside a bit of apple over a grainy malt base. The flavor delivers a more grassy maltiness, and some distinctly floral hop notes. Although the malt is fairly forward in the mix it remains really nicely balanced by a stiff bitterness and delicate acidity that eventually lead to a dry finish with some floral, spicy, and gently herbal hops lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied and gently crisp with a fine-bubbled, standard carbonation. Früh is one of the most famous, and popular brauhausen in Köln and their beer is a classic of the style. Unfortunately the beer is no longer brewed in house, but that allows for greater QA and consistency.

Finishes with a light sweetness and bitterness and some grainy, grassy notes lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a light body and strong carbonation.

While this does have a decent balance of sweet, grainy malt and grassy, floral hops going on, it's a tad to sweet and floral for my personal taste and I'm also not a huge fan of those light light estery notes.May 02, 2019"

Monteith's Original Ale,2.75,3.25,2.5,2.0,"Format: standard 330mL brown bottle with a simple but stylish label.

Appearance: mid dark amber in colour, with a very flat head that fritters away to almost nothing. Looks a bit ordinary.

Aroma: the aroma is of light apple and some bready yeasts behind. Decent if a little uninspired.

Taste: again the apple and bread flavours are there, but there is a quite unpleasant flavour bursting through from the over-carbonation.

Aftertaste: the main flavour that draws through is the metallic fug from the carbonation.

Mouth feel: light to moderate in body with that over carbonation that pretty much ruins the beer.

Overall: not a brilliant beer from Monteith's, which is getting to be a standard. The carbonation is too high, which alters and ruins the flavour. Definitely not for AU$60 a case.Dec 07, 2014"

Poured into a straight pint glass. A clear coppery-amber colour with low carbonation. Forms a large head of creamy off-white foam that lasts for a couple of minutes before subsiding. Aroma of caramel malt with hints of grain, fruity ale yeast, subtle dried fruit and stewed hops. Dry and slightly earthy, with a background whiff of cardboard.

Tastes of mild caramel malt with a dry finish. Notes of fruity ale yeast, wet grain, a hint of dried fruit, faint sugar and stewed leaves. Dry and a tad rustic, with a slight cardboard presence. A subtle bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth and tingly, with restrained carbonation and decent body. Somewhat astringent, with a stale aftertaste of mild caramel and stewed leaves.

Meh - a pretty average ale. Surprisingly dark for a 'pale ale'; it's more of an amber/brown ale to be fair. Both aroma and flavour have an unexciting malty/yeasty character, with hops hardly accounted for. Mouthfeel is OK.

Well packaged and presented, I was looking forward to what the brewer calls its 'original' ale. 

It's a lightly malty, bready smell and pours an a decent glass but the taste is simply non-eventful. First up you get some nice caramel, malt, banana, brown sugar but the palate is left alone at the altar after the initial introduction.

Mild malty and dusty aroma. There's a touch of earthy nuttiness but nothing particularly special or commendable.

Smooth malt, slightly earthy hops but ultimately an emptiness that lets this beer down. It seems to suffer from Monteiths-itis, a disease which inflicts ordinariness on a beer that otherwise has potential.

Monteith's Original Ale,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,"Tried while in transit at Auckland Airport, although also tried before and not reviewed. This appears to be the lucky one, so let's see how it does.

Pours a dark, deep coppery colour, slightly tinged with orange, but with only a minimal head of fine white lace around the outside. Looks very still and flat, similar to its progenitors in the English Pale Ale style. Not bad, but not that inspiring.

Bit of grainy malt and sweet sugar water on the nose. Very mild, and a little weak. A little sweaty, earthy and organic hop character, but only if you really search for it. It's not terrible, but it's pretty bland.

Taste is similar. Very mild lightly grainy malt character, giving just a touch of coloured malts, with a sugary welling midpalate and a rather dry finish. Feel is thin and light, but without crispness—fair enough for the style, but the thinness is rather unappealing.

Eh. It's a pretty average brew, but not appalling or offensive. Decent enough to drink occasionally, but not exciting enough to warrant drinking often.Apr 29, 2011"

Creamy top to a tawny-looking brew. Hints of crusty baguette, caramel, yeast and a fine berry sweetness in the aroma. Some what lighter bodied and pretty smooth. Hops are very modest here, letting the yeast and malt show more. A bit of toasted biscuit and bread crust with some caramel sweetness deep within. Yeastiness comes across chalky and dry, but compliments the malt very well. Semidry finish with a growing drinkability.

Monteith's Original Ale,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,"Pours a one finger off-white head that fades quickly to a ring leaving some lace. Malty nose. Deep clear mahogany color.

Monteith's Original Ale,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,"Poured a clear medium mahogany amber into a pint glass with a nice off white two fingered head with alot of sticky lacing. Aromas of sweet malt and carmel with a slight hint of hops. On the palette this brew offered up a sweet brassy metallic taste not what I expected. Lighter body than most EPA's with a little bit to much carbonation feel on the tongue. This may have been an old date wise brew so further tasting will need to be done.Jul 16, 2010"
Monteith's Original Ale,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,"Pours a dark amber color with a head that is very quick to fade. Interesting presentation.

Aroma is full of buttery malt with just a touch of hops present. Seems about right for the style.

Taste is full of buttery malt with a hint of caramel, followed by just a hint of hops. Certainly fits the style it's trying to convey. 

Mouthfeel is full of lingering buttery/caramel flavors. Not much else.

Not bad. I'd say it's average for the style and a bit too dark.Jul 13, 2010"

T: Follows the nose, plus some lemony hops & slight grainyness up front. Grassy & lemony hops dominate as this warms, plus a touch of mineral hoppyness as well layered under grainy bread flavor. Finishes crisp but starts to go a bit watery

MF: Medium bodied, fairly low carbonation, okay balance

Drinks alright, but not hoppy or malty enough to really hold your attention for very long, not near as interesting as their black ale was...May 05, 2010"
Monteith's Original Ale,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,"A: dark amber or light brown color, filtered, lots of carb bubbles and thin but lasting white creamy foam head leaving light lacing.
S: has a well balanced caramel malt and light aromatic hop smell but would mostly say maltiness is the main aroma.
T: taste is good but typical, caramel malt flavor mixed with bittering hops that really come out in the aftertaste also tastes like the brewer used some type of filler like corn or rice in the mash.
M/D: true to the statement on the label the feel is smooth and light bodied which something I was not expecting. The drinkability is good but due to the malty sweetness I can't say I could drink many of these.Apr 24, 2010"

Brooklyn Brown Ale,3.25,3.75,3.75,3.5,"12oz bottle pours a deep reddish brown with a tan-white head that foams up quickly and disappears quickly. Aroma is rich, roasted malts and some hops.

Bitterness is just at the right amount, and not over-hopped. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy and smooth.

Pretty good beer, will buy again.Aug 07, 2021"
Brooklyn Brown Ale,4.0,3.75,3.75,3.5,"This one pours a darkish brown color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This smells like nutty malt, caramel, and tea-like hops.

This is pretty solid, if not a tad unmemorable. There's a solid nutty and caramel malt sort of flavor, with a very light hop character. It does finish a little bit watery on the back end, a bit too watery for my personal preferences.

This is light bodied, slightly creamy but also thin, with a decent drinkability.

I wanted a bit more out of this one, although it's not bad by any means.Jun 15, 2021"
Brooklyn Brown Ale,3.75,4.0,3.75,4.0,"Best by 5/2021

Back with yet another discount rack beer, this one $1.50 for a single. I figured since it's one of Brooklyn's more popular beers that I should give it a shot. The bottle states ""The O.G. Brown Ale"" which I don't doubt, but the ratings don't exactly reflect on an exceptional beer. Regardless, I wanna find out for myself so let's dive in

Pours a clear dark amber with red hues and 2 fingers of light tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

The nose on this one reminds me more of an English brown ale, with more expressive malt and yeast, so I'm quite enjoying this so far. I'm picking up on aromas of toasted bread, caramel, nutty brown malt, light raisin, herbal hops, and chocolate

Considerably less English-leaning in taste, but it's made up for with a delicate balance. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting sweet malt, peppery hops, and a touch of fruit. The swallow brings notes of earthy English hops, toasted bread, raisin, and toffee

A light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a slick and easy drinking beer. Finishes mostly dry with a lingering bitterness

This one was pretty good. It's nothing amazing, but it's quite solid and sessionableApr 06, 2021"
Brooklyn Brown Ale,4.0,3.75,3.75,3.5,"Fairly large beige head atop a deep brown body. Woodsy, roasted malt aroma, some caramel, with a whiff of walnut. Modestly sweet malt taste, dry, respectably hopped. Medium bodied, well carbonated mouthfeel. Short lived, slightly metallic finish.Apr 04, 2021"
Brooklyn Brown Ale,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Clear dark brown beer with a dense dark tan foam...

Brooklyn Brown Ale,4.5,3.5,4.0,4.0," oz bottle from St. Louis MO
Best by Jan 2021
Into Carpe Brew Em Snifter.

Pours a bold brown coffee bean color with a tall creamy off-white head of 2 fingers, receding to 1, leaving walls of creamy lace up the sides. It's gorgeous and just doesn't quit.

Aroma from the glass is decidedly metallic, with a little bit of nutty brown malt and chocolate dust behind it. Not much else here. 

Flavor is sweet and malty, with a touch of perfume and a touch of chocolate. It's very tasty and welcoming. There's not a whole lot to ponder, it just steps right out front and gives it all to you at once. The perfume note is a bit off-putting but thankfully it's not that loud and gets overshadowed by the nutty malt and chocolate malt. 

Feel is roasty as well, with a medium body, semi-creamy, moderate-heavy carb, and mild alcohol heat. It's pretty textbook for a brown. 

Overall, an enjoyable brown ale that would be a good choice on tap at a pizza house or just a good 6 banger if I were to get it near me. Unfortunately we don't get Brooklyn (not a huge loss), but if we were to, this would be in my beer rotation a few times a year.

The smell is somewhat sour and metallic, with generic toasty grains, grassy hops, and maybe a hint of cocoa?
The taste has a bit of that sourness and metallic-ness, but there is more toast, cocoa powder, milk chocolate, and cocoa. Some grassy hops. More bitterness than expected. Coffee! Dry, moderately bitter, with lingering roast.
The feel is medium-light, well carbonated, crisp and fairly smooth. Dry and chalky.

Brooklyn Brown Ale,4.0,4.25,4.25,3.75," oz. can aggressively poured into a 16 oz Mug. I often find the need for a strong pour with brown ales, this helps the smell and head look.
Dark transparent brown with a tan head , normal retention for the style.
Sweet malty smell, also a slight yeast smell like baked bread.
This beer is on the sweet side though out the pallet, some chocolate and caramel flavors. Not to hoppy at the finish.
Typically medium bodied and lightly carbonated.
Overall, I rate this beer higher than most. I feel this is an excellent representation of the style and brown ales are my favorite. This beer is not overly hoppy , could be a border line English Brown.
All fans of brown ales should try this.Jun 08, 2018"
Brooklyn Brown Ale,3.75,4.0,4.0,3.75,"The deep brown beer with some reddish highlights pours out into a Duvel glass with a 1/2” light tan head that slowly but visibly begins to recede leaving an irregular web and ring of leggy lacing around the sides of the glass. Sipping creates two arches and lots of small patches and legs of lacing. Eventually the foam becomes a thin irregular island on the surface of the liquid.

The aromas are filled with lightly toasted caramel malt. There’s also some light chocolate, some nuttiness and a touch of herbal character.

The flavors are much as expected from the nose with the lightly toasted caramel malt up front against a background that has some chocolate, some nuttiness and some herbal character. In addition to some malt sweetness there’s just a bit of coffee and some slightly bitter herbal notes.

The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium bodied and fairly smooth with small bubbled light carbonation. The fairly long finish begins as the malt sweetness and chocolate begin to fade allowing the herbal bitterness to become more noticeable before it too begins to fade away to the back of the palate in a semi-dry ending that shows just a touch of chocolate as everything slowly disappears.

Overall I’m finding this a very drinkable brown ale and am enjoying both the various well balanced flavors and the semi-dry lightly bitter ending that still has a hint of chocolate and that keeps the slightly toasted malt sweetness from dominating the flavor profile or the ending.May 20, 2018"

Floreffe Prima Melior,4.0,3.5,4.25,4.25,"L- Almost black to the eye, thought held up next to a halogen it's a super-dark chestnut ruby. Slight haze. Pours with 2Cm pillowy med/dark tan head.
S- A slightly piquant and liquor-ish smell.
T- 1st sip -> It's pretty malty, then into a deep toasty grains/malts, and it keeps building until about 5 seconds later the intensity rises again on the tongue/palate in a third wave (with a brushing of ABV% zing) into something quite pungent. These waves keeps repeating on each further sip... now on about my 5th sip. Unusual/really nice!
F- Notably deep, quite pungently toasty with richness and hops all in equilibrium.
O- Well I never, this has turned out to me quite a star. It's super-easy to drink as a slow-sippin' beer. Great for coller months. I'd very happily drink this one again. Shame I couldn't register the spicing/Smell much here but I get bad Springtime congestion and that's what happens. I hope others get to enjoy the spicy facets more!
What a lovely beer. One of those ones you hope to be good, that turns out to be something special. The way the Taste reatedly grew+ebbed - I've had such before, but usually only 2 maybe 3 cycles until the palate adjusts and you no longer notice it; here is just went on and on.

Floreffe Prima Melior,4.0,3.5,3.75,3.75,"330ml bottle - the last of the '1/2 Meter of Beer' mix-pack from this brewery, and now finally something of the darker and heavier Belgian persuasion.

This beer pours a mostly clear, very dark cherry cola tinted brown colour, with a teeming tower (aaaah, refermentation in the bottle) of puffy, thinly frothy, and fairly fizzy beige head, which leaves some decent sudsy limestone arch lace around the glass as it quickly subsides.

It smells of semi-sweet black fruit - raisins, dates, prunes, and dried cherries - somewhat sugary bready caramel malt, black licorice, muddled savoury spice (maybe it's coriander, maybe it's not), and a bit of earthy, musty yeast. The taste is grainy, kind of doughy caramel malt, tight, but not quite tart dark fruit (generally the same cats from the nose), a stronger sweet and tangy anise character, more hard to delineate earthy spice - ok, I'll just say coriander, and leave it at that - and a dry earthiness that is more hoppy than yeasty in provenance.

The carbonation is still quite frizzante all over my numerous palates after that initial outburst, the body medium-light in weight, especially for the style, and more or less smooth, neither yeast or alcohol caring to interfere here. It finishes just a tad off-dry, the caramel malt and candy-like licorice carrying the day against the countermeasures of the ethereal yeast and stealthy, encroaching booze.

Not a bad BSDA by any stretch of the imagination, but by the same token, a bit of a boy among men, when comparing it to the better-known abbey and laic versions readily available, like yer Gouden Carolus and even various Unibroue offerings. Nice to try, and duly warming after a spell, but I'm afraid my memory banks just don't have room for this one.Jun 20, 2014"
Floreffe Prima Melior,3.75,3.25,3.5,3.0,"Bottle: an incredibly solid tall brown 750mL bottle. A standard Belgian old-school label.

Appearance: pours a dark brown with highlights, limited visible carbonation. A tan head drops from two fingers to one fairly quickly, and settles to a rocky cream. Very little lacing.

Aroma: some sweet malts with spice, a touch of heavy fruits. Really not much to it though, which is a bit disappointing for a Belgian ale.

Taste: heavy fruits and spices with some caramel malts. Not the most brilliant Belgian Strong I have had to date, but still quite drinkable.

Aftertaste: the fruits are joined by a touch of star anise. Still lacks some complexity.

Mouth feel: a light- to-moderate body with mild carbonation. A bit lacking.

Overall: not the most impressive Belgian Strong Dark Ale I have had to date. Some heavy fruits and spice with caramels, but really nothing too impressive. Still fairly drinkable, but you can get something better for an equivalent price.Apr 17, 2014"

Smells of caramel, yeast and alcohol faintly.

I was surprized when reading other reviews. This bottle tasted like Trappist Rochefort without any candy sugar - I tasted no coriander or orange. I wonder if this was a defective batch since my overall impression was of a beer with an obvious gap in the flavor profile.

Floreffe Prima Melior,3.75,4.0,3.5,4.5,"General: Received this with the rare beer of the month club. It's a wine bottle size with a cork and basket seal. The carbonation upon opening the bottle was good, a nice hiss when I opened it. I'm enjoying this beer out of my New Belgium tulip style glass.

Appearance: very dark brown, nearly black with some ruby hues to it. The head is an off white that dissipates fairly quickly but does leave some decent lacing. 

Aroma: A nice maltiness with some hints of orange and the star anise. Not a big fan of the aromas of this but it's a unique beer that's for sure.

Mouthfeel: medium body with high carbonation. There is a nice drying effect with this. 

Taste: There's a lot of flavors going on with this beer. Star anise and orange peel are the forefront of this but there is a good back up on this. Not a huge fan of this beer, it's just not my style.

Overall: As far as the style is concerned its very different than some of the other strong ales that i've had. It's a combination between a strong ale and a spiced ale. Just not my thing. I think that the rare beer of the month club needs to drop this one from it's rotation.Feb 25, 2014"

Floreffe Prima Melior,4.25,4.0,3.75,3.75,"Appearance: Deep mahogany body, surmounted by a large, dense tan head, which retains well. Superb, fine unbroken lacing adorns the glass walls.

Aroma: Brown sugar, dark fruit, anise, orange rind, and sweet vinous alcohol comprise the complex and beguiling aroma.

Taste: Opens with very bread-like dark malt, similar to a European dark bread. Later in the taste, dark fruits (figs, plums), and some lightly charred malts appear. Coriander and anise soon appear, but in restrained quantities. From the inception of the taste to its close, there is a sweet undercurrent of vinous alcohol. Late in the taste, there is a quite restrained flourish of herbal hops.

Mouth feel: Smooth, soft, very pleasant. 

Drinkability/notes: A solid, drinkable example, while not extraordinary, s in a little more over-the-top, its not bad at all. Would prove itself elegant at a holiday dinner.

T: The dominant flavor is really brown sugar most likely because of the addition of dark belgian candi sugar. Dried dark fruits like in the smell are also present. Figs, plums, prunes, and dates come to mind. Perhaps a bit of apricot as well. The alcohol once again is to prevalent and is displeasing to an otherwise well done beer. A bit metallicy at times as well.

M: Fairly dry and a touch to thin for me. Crispness is good however.

O: A fairly decent beer with the main problem being noticeable alcohol. Wouldn't recommend it or buy it again but it was a good experience.May 21, 2013"

Floreffe Prima Melior,4.25,3.75,3.75,3.5,"330 ml bottle served at Het Waterhuis in Ghent and served in its branded goblet. On to the beer:

Who likes a fluffy head which retains well? I do. I also like the dark brown color with reddish hues of this beer. The nose of toasted malt, kiss of chocolate, and a dose of cherry make a pleasant aroma. A good flavor continues the momentum, which starts with dark chocolate and toast. A kiss of tartness adds a little something different. Brown sugar notes too. Its aftertaste withers into a semi-sweet flavor. Regarding its feel, the beer is medium full with pleasing carbonation and somewhat acidic sensation. 

Agreeable strong dark ale, and one that doesn't weigh you down too much.May 18, 2013"
Floreffe Prima Melior,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,"Huge foam-up that dissipates to some streamers of froth. 

Distinctive flavor of nuts, spice, pumpkin pie, licorice-- the whole candy store. Besides ""canesugar"" the label lists spices, so maybe the wise ones will know if this is spiced up like Anchor Christmas ale, which is exactly what this tastes like-- only sweeter. Clean flavors, no hint of oxidation or other odd flavors, but it's just very plain, just lots of cinnamon, allspice and such.

For the ridiculous foam and the excess of additives, and the lack of Belgian flavors, I don't rate this very high. However, I suppose you could call this a Winter Warmer and enjoy it with a slice of fruitcake. From the 33 cl botle bought at Beer And Gin House in Gent.Oct 05, 2012"
Floreffe Prima Melior,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,"0ml bottle poured into a Leffe chalice by freshness date.

A:
Blackish opaque brown with massive rocky frothy head that retains very well then leaves several lacing patches stick to a glass once dissipated.

S:
Dark and roasted malt, dark fruits reminiscence of raisins and some sweet portion of sugarcane, a little bit spice from alcohol.

T+M:
Quite complex, it comprises by 3 tiers. I – Barley malt and roasted malt kick off after sip. This portion also lends some bready and astringent traits. II – Following by dark fruit esters generate by yeast. III – Sugarcanes bring sweetness until the finish with slight bitterness from hop hiding in. Alcohol fusel can be detectable along mid-way to the finish. The body is medium with right amount of carbonation.

S- fruity, flowery aroma with a hint of yeast.

T- Overwhelmingly sweet. This beer could do with some taming of the sugar. Very yeasty
MF- so sweet, it’s difficult to find it a pleasant experience. 

O- Thank God I’m not diabetic. Maybe it would do better aged for some time, but I am having trouble finishing this bottle. The beer had good intentions, but did not deliver. Hell, it looked and smelt great... I would not buy this beer again.Jan 06, 2012"

Revisiting this guy, complete with review, after remembering enjoying it about a year ago. I let it warm up a bit from the fridge (just FYI). It pours a dark-ish ruby-brown topped by a finger of slightly-off cream foam. The nose comprises rye bread, Belgian yeast, nutmeg, figs, brown sugar-cinnamon, pecans, and oak. The taste brings in all of these for a reunion, along with some red apple skin, black grapes, black pepper, and a touch of cocoa and vanilla. The body is a medium that yearns to lean to the lighter side, with a very light moderate carbonation and a lightly grainy feel. Overall, a very nice BSDA, one that affirmed my memory (always a plus) and seemed to please the lady (always a plus). Good times here all around.Jul 22, 2011"

S- Amazingly malty, the maltiest beer I'd smelled for a long while. Difficult to divine anything else.
T- Very malty tasty on the fore, into some toasty notes and a hoppy dry lick into the finish.
F- I like it in that it has somewhat of a pungent flavour (well, as much as an ABV of 5.1% can allow for) and yet it's got plenty sufficient of hoppy zing on the palate to be refreshing.
O- I'm not much into dark beers that are lower ABV%, as they can be pungently flavoured but with insufficient body/ABV% to provide balance. This is one of the lower ABV% ones I've had that works really pretty well.

Flavors seems off for a Munich Dunkel. Has a slightly sour twang to it. Think cherry. Maybe they don’t clean their lines. Caramel, cocoa. Not a fan of this. Will edit review when I revisit.Oct 01, 2019"
Konig Ludwig Dunkel,3.5,2.5,3.0,2.75,"cl bottle, 6m old.

Reddish brown, decent foam. Regular looking for a dunkel.

Nose is quite timid. A bit of sweet dark bread is all there is.

Taste is quite light, like a regular helles with some roasted aftertaste and a bit of sweetness in the middle. Very standard dunkel for these days. Carbonation is a tad too pronounced, but that is obviously to provide a bit of acidity to enhance similar notes from the roasted malts to enliven things by all means possible. 

Overall, I am a bit puzzled.. I remembered this beer to be better from decades ago. I double checked Michael Jackson's old article from 1998 and he describes there a mostly Munich malt beer with a bit of Belgian aromatic malt and carafa, going on to describe that it is dry hopped as well. Now, that sounds tasty and traditional. I cannot believe this current version has any dry hopping, and the base malt cannot be munich by any means.. I would guess at least half is pilsner malt, there is probably caramunich for the sweetness and then carafa for colour. A disappointment wrt expectations, but of course a good example of modern dunkel, which will disappear eventually if it's just coloured helles with a bit of caramel. I think they have also tried to boost the thinnish body with an overuse of chloride, there is that aftertaste that gets stronger once I started wondering about the water profile. This beer masquerades quite skillfully, but it is not what a dunkel could be.Feb 23, 2019"

Sweet & malty, almost like a doppelbock in some respects. While the beer wasn't exactly anything special, it is still a drink that I wouldn't mind having again.May 07, 2014"
Primator Polotmavy 13,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,"A - Crystal clear amber in color. A tight knit cream colored head that holds up very well. Thick sheets of lacing with a thick ceiling of micro-bubbles. A mix of full sheets and spiderweb patterns of lacing.

S - Sweet malt with a touch of toasted cereal grain. Floral honey, brown sugar, grassy hops.

T - Saaz hops hits right away along with a sweet malt with honey and flowers in the background. Dusty lager yeast marries with the grassy hops and create a solid edge to balance out the sweet malt. Finishes sweet before quickly turning dry.

M - Heavy medium body, great flowy carbonation.

Great looking beer. Just what you'd expect from a Czech Marzen. Great malt profile with plenty of noble hops to balance it out. Very satisfying.Nov 19, 2011"
Primator Polotmavy 13,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,"I poured the 330 ml bottle into a pint-style glass. It made a small head on top of a surprisingly dark reddish-brown beer. 

I do not often drink Märzen, but I liked this brew. It does not have a particularly distinct smell and the taste seems fairly balanced between malts and hops. The malts hit the palate first, but they are very quickly matched by other flavors. That almost sounds bland, but there are definitely some interesting (if mild) things going on in the mix. I found it very drinkable -- had a glass 2 nights in a row, in fact because I enjoyed the first one. I could have had another without any problem on either night.Nov 08, 2011"
Primator Polotmavy 13,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,"A: Reddish dark gold with a medium large off-white, kind of compact head that slowly sinks into decent lacings.

S: Lots of Saaz-noble hops, a bit creamy. Semi-sweet malt, I'm guessing there's some wheat in it, but just a little. Some fruits.

T: The noble hops are great. Then the malt is just sweet enough. Bitterness. Fruits. Some mellow spices.

M: Aftertaste is long and bitter with a little trace of sweetness. Body is medium and carbonation the same.

O: This is a malty beer with lots of noble hops. If you find it, buy it, enjoy it.Apr 28, 2011"
Primator Polotmavy 13,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Out of the mixed 6-box

Dark gold with a light tan head this beer smells nutty and malty in real pleasant nose. Good malt profile with a solid slightly sweet finish. I really like Octoberfests and this is a very nice example of the style. Very drinkable but full bodied. What I like about Primator is that they produce a large range of lagers for a Czech brewer. I wish this beer was sold in singles as it would be my go to this Fall.Jun 20, 2008"
Primator Polotmavy 13,4.5,4.5,3.0,3.0,"This was poured from the bottle into a pint glass. It has a wonderful head, very thick and mousse-like. The color is a clear orange. The aroma is primarily sweet malt with just a trace of noble hops. Sweet malt dominates the flavor almost entirely with some hops noted on the finish. It taste is not as exciting as the aroma. I'm also noting some alcohol as it warms a bit. It has a medium body with moderate carbonation.

Overall, this is a decent enough Marzen. It's not very distinct though. I suppose the appearance and aroma were so wonderful that the taste was a little bit of a let down.May 24, 2007"
Primator Polotmavy 13,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Selection of the Beer-of-the-Month Club
Poured a deep amber color with massive slightly off-white heed. Nice retention.
Smell is a nice combination of sweet summer fruits (peaches, apricots), caramel and toffee.
Taste is also very nice, blending the sweet fruity malt with a nice hop bitterness at the finishs.
Leaves a very enoyable taste in the mouth.
Extremely drinkable. This beer really suprised me. The perfect combination of malt, hops and freshing drinkability. This would be an excellent beer to session.May 12, 2007"
Primator Polotmavy 13,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,"Well this is an interesting beer. It's rare to find a European marzen with as much spice and hop character as this one. It pours a dark clear amber color, minimal white head. Aroma is slightly spicy, musty, and sugary.

There is a nice malt flavor up front, which is then infused with a strong (but not overbearing) spice presence. And then right on the tail of that is a grassy, earthy hop profile that not only rounds out the beer but makes it one of the more interesting ones I've had in recent times. Mouthfeel is medium, creamy, and the finish is smooth, if a bit dry. 

Overall this is quite a unique take on the marzen genre, and one that I'd recommend if you're looking for something a bit different. It may not be for everyone, but it certainly is different.Apr 05, 2007"
Primator Polotmavy 13,4.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,"A March ""Beer of the Month"" selection. I've never seen it before and the only reviews I've seen have been from Europe. Beautifully dark amber color with nice tan head that stayed through the first few sips. Mostly malt (carmel, rich toasted malt) in the nose and again in the taste. A bit of fruity hops comes through on the tongue, providing a slight bitterness that adds to the drinkability. The aftertaste is all malt, with a carmel and butter notes. A Czech Märzen that (almost) rivals the Germans in taste. Very enjoyable.Mar 26, 2007"
Whistler bear Paw Honey Lager,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,"Clear brown-amber with almost no head. There are a few bubbles sitting at the surface. No lacing. Almost no bubbles rising in the glass.

Smells of sweet malts, getting close to a toffee. There is something slightly sharp. Swirling the glass kicked up a strong scent of barnyard that quickly faded. A faint smell of wet cardboard.

The overall flavor profile is milder than the scent. There is some light, indistinct malt. A little too much sweetness, either sugar or honey. At times there is a little bit of dried, ground green peas. The barnyard shows up as a bit of an off flavor, not quite funky, but a little more biting. Overall rather disappointing flavor, and not at all like a lager.

The carbonation almost burns the tongue as it builds to a fine bubbled foam that quickly dissipates.

Disappointing. The flavors never seem to mesh with each other. This is a long way from being a lager style. The adjunct has taken over.Feb 23, 2020"

Tastes of honeyed bread crust, more sugary nuts and some faint weedy hops.

Feels thin and pricky. Thin bodied with fizzy carbonation. Finishes off-sweet.

Whistler bear Paw Honey Lager,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,"Had from the bottle from LCBO West coast taster pack. I actually quite enjoyed this beer. Good appearance, aromas are floral and with a bit of nice honey undertones, pears, and bready malts.

Taste is a bit too sweet and bready to start but lots of the honey and fruity floral notes start to come through and it dries up a little bit toward the finish, toasty bread with honey, still quite malty on the finish, but its clean.

M light, refreshing, a bit sweet and grainy, honey adds some earthy notes, and there is some nice dryness to the finish.

Definitely more flavourful than your average lager, nice balance and honey incorporation, drinks well, just a bit sweet.Feb 17, 2015"
Whistler bear Paw Honey Lager,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.25,"If I was to compare this to other adjunct lagers, it would be world class.

Whistler bear Paw Honey Lager,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,"330 mL bottle, part of this year's BC Craft Brewers Guild sampler (which is now available at the LCBO); bottled March 20 2014. There was a time (early on) in my beer-drinking career where I was a big fan of honey lagers - including staples like Sleeman's Honey Brown and even Lakeport's shoddy substitute. It'll be nice to revisit my roots. Served well-chilled.

Pours an attractive, clear amber colour, topped with just over one finger's worth of soapy, off-white froth. It seeps away steadily over the next few minutes, leaving behind a thin film and narrow collar. The aroma is very sweet - honey and red licorice candy come to mind, with notes of caramel and corny cereal grains. For the style, this is well-above average at this point. 

A decent honey lager, but still a little too sweet for my tastes. Pale malts, corn grits and caramel complement the marked honey sweetness, which remains fairly dominant into the aftertaste. On the lighter side of medium-bodied, with a creamy mouthfeel accented by the moderate carbonation levels. This is a supremely drinkable lager, although due to its sweet nature I don't know if I'd be able to tolerate it all night. Fans of Sleeman's Honey Lager will have little trouble adjusting to this one. 

Final Grade: 3.59, a B grade. Bear Paw Honey Lager is not a stellar beer, but it's drinkable enough and a fair substitute for any mass-produced red lager - e.g. Rickard's or Keith's Red. This is really more of an amber than an adjunct lager, although technically speaking honey *is* an adjunct, so I'll just snip that tangent in the bud right there. One of the best adjunct lagers I've ever had, anyway. I could see myself drinking this once in a while if it were available in ON, but it would depend on the price point.Aug 13, 2014"
Whistler bear Paw Honey Lager,3.5,3.75,3.75,4.25,"A- Pours a clear yet robust golden honey color, and there is a good bit of big bubbly carbonation throughout the liquid. The head is a mixture of bristly large bubbles and smooth dense foam....the head looks really unsettled as it dissipates into a somewhat thick-ish layer. The lacing is interesting....watery yet oily looking, and not a whole lot of foam clings to the glass.

S- Very much of honey....this is by far the dominant aroma going on here. Other than this it doesn't offer much else to the nasal cavity....clean grainy smells, modest malt and perhaps some corn/rice. It is a sweet smelling lager, of course due to the honeyed quality but is very reminiscent of a lager aroma wise anyways...

T- More of the same happening here, with a very dominant honey flavor....now this isn't a bad thing...Whistler does a very good job of making this the primary character of the beer, there just isn't much else to talk about here. It's cleanly flavored, and the finish does have a modest bitter taste that helps to balance out the palate for the next taste.

M- This is quite a smooth creamy lager if I do say so! The carbonation is deceiving by looks, as it the bubbles aren't zesty at all on the palate, but provide a complimentary burst of honey flavor. The body isn't full by any means but definitely leans towards medium. Overall this category doesn't disappoint!

O- Overall this is a very decent honey lager that delivers on the primary flavor that they were going for, and I've tried several similar type of beers that don't go as far as this one does. I would buy this again, and think this makes an excellent dessert brew and would do well with a spicy Asian dish to help balance things out.Jun 19, 2013"
Whistler bear Paw Honey Lager,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.25,"Whistler has been making a big splash in Alberta with its great looking packaging and fantastic tasting beers. This is among the most popular ones.

It's not everyday that I see an adjunct lager and say that it's well made, but this is such a case. It pours a brilliant brown colour with a relatively quickly dissipating head. There's a good hit of honey in the aroma, as well as malt and a little corn.

The taste is really pleasant - you notice the honey in the beer very suddenly and you experience a little bit of corny aftertaste, but it's not really unpleasant at all. However, it is really one dimensional, as all I can make out is sweetness from this beer. That's not to say it's bad, but it isn't very exciting either. The feel is smooth and you have a nice hit of carbonation in your throat. 

To the average beer drinker, they likely won't notice the adjunct taste. More experienced drinkers will likely pick it up. However, unless you're so adamantly against drinking anything with adjuncts in it, you likely won't be put off by it. Not bad, but but not very outstanding. Still, it is tasty enough for me to recommend it.Jun 17, 2013"
Whistler bear Paw Honey Lager,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.75,"This beer pours a clear golden brown with a moderate head that dissipates quite quickly. You can pick up the scent of honey, and other than that, it smells like, well, lager. I taste mainly the honey, but it's not overly sweet. A bit malty. Medium bodied, not overly carbonated. This is a very pleasant, easy drinking beer that I can easily see becoming a summer favourite.May 19, 2013"
Whistler bear Paw Honey Lager,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,"An enjoyable honey lager with a nice copper colour. An easy sipper and enjoyable on a nice summer day. Very subtle hints of honey but blends in well.

Taste- Mild sweetness of the honey comes through along with malts. Slight hint of brown rice.

Mouthfeel- Light to medium bodied with a light carbonation. A surprising silky smoothness. 

Overall- An easy drinking lager by Whistler. Very mild flavours but the sweet honey taste and smooth texture makes this quite enjoyable. I see this as a summer refresher. Could use a little work around the edges but still worth a try.Feb 18, 2012"
Whistler bear Paw Honey Lager,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,"0ml bottle. I don't see how this isn't just the normal honey lager all gussied up in mountain lore imagery, but, with apologies to David Coverdale, here I go again.

This beer pours a clear, bright medium copper amber hue, with two pudgy fingers of puffy, thinly foamy, and fizzy off-white head, which disappears slowly and surely before my eyes, leaving some weird Simpson-esque amoebic lace around the glass. 

It smells of sweet bready pale malt, a touch of corny grain, and mildly mollifying bland and musty honey, with not a lot going on hop-wise. The taste is bready, of the generally corn-oriented sort, much-lessened earthy honey, a mild dose of weedy, somewhat herbal hops, and a niggling sour tang that does its best Princess and the Pea number on me. 

The carbonation is rather sedate, just a wan frothiness throughout, the body medium-light in weight, and arguably smooth, though a slight cloying tingle becomes increasingly hard to ignore. It finishes off-dry, the aforementioned graininess and plain as the day is long honey still running this particular sideshow.

Nothing renamed, nothing gained, I suppose. Another average, run of the mill honey beer - the Canadian beer-scape is littered with such middling fare. Good for only when an apres-ski hook-up invariably depends upon its, erm, 'lubricating' presence. And for that, I salute it.Dec 26, 2011"

Mahogany color in the glass with a touch of gold. Kind of a metallic, canned scent. Lacing is nice with a decent carbonated mouthfeel. More sparkly on the tongue. Initially, a bit of malt sweetness on the tongue. Bitterness comes on unexpectedly strong since there is not much hop aroma. Charcoal and muddy flavors make this less pleasant than other softer dark German beers. I would say it is a big dose of burnt malt that gives the sourish bitterness.May 13, 2010"

Pours a clear cola color under a thin one finger tan head that disappears completely pretty quickly, much like a cola would. There's a touch of caramel in the nose, plus a hint of hops. The mouth is mildly carbonated and quite light. There's some caramel malt here, but it's pretty watery. A touch of crisp German hops comes out a bit later, giving the brew a touch of character and a little dry tickle at the back of the throat.

Schmucker Schwarzbier,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,"Thin, fine bubbled head gives way to a thin layer of lace, floating atop a dark garnet brew.

Aromas of dark malt and black licorace predominate, but aren't overwhelming.

Taste has hints of molasses, baker's chocolate, pumpernickel. Noble hops are present at a moderate level.

A bit thin, and high on carbonation, but definitely drinkable for the fact that it's been on sale here cheaper than many popular macros.

Not spectacular, just something to have handy when I don't want to open something better.Nov 20, 2004"
Schmucker Schwarzbier,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,"I like dark lager. This was not as dark as I'd have expected, and not as sweet. The first sip was smooth and creamy, but the hops seemed to bite in a little hard like a cheaper beer. The scent was pleasant--a good mix of hop and honey. I must admit, I didn't expect a lot from this beer at all as I got a case for $11 at the distributor (usually i pay that for a 12 or even a 6--depending on what it is). Frankly I was expecting it to be pretty lame. had there been a little less hop, I think it would have been a much better beer...but i am a homebrewer, and I like hops not-so-much. If you like a bit more hop, this might be just what you are looking for. smooth, just a little thin...clean, dry finish...with a hint of smoke on the back of the tongue.

Schmucker Schwarzbier,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,"Schmucker Schwarzbier was well-described by the previous reviewer. The light beige head slowly receded into oblivion and lacing was not left to mark its passage. The aroma was pleasantly reminiscent of honey, malt and fruit.

Schmucker Schwarzbier,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,"Brown bottle, freshness dated. Pours a deep red/chestnut color with a not-so-long-lasting offwhite head. The aroma is pure German - malty with background of noble hops, probably Hallertau.

Round, sweetish malt - typically German, with a fruity, honeylike decoction sweetness and noble hop in unison. Very faint dark fruity malt flavor way in the background - just enough to differentiate it from a dunkel. OK body, but a bit thinner than Kostritzer Schwarzbier. Finishes with a slightly drier, malt/grain flavor that cuts the edge of the sweetness and makes it very quaffable.

First time I recall it being snappy grassy crisp, this is malty and carries some of the flavor notes you’d associate with a Belgian quad but riding on a lighter less carmelized format. I neglected to put carefully and have a constellation of sediment in this chalice, perhaps that lends some doughy body to what I previously considered a snappy tripel. Interesting look at a beer altered by time. One of my favorite Belgians, wish I had a fresher one nearby to compare with.Sep 05, 2021"

Sweet, but not too sweet. Nice bitter bite at the end as well. Overall really nice. Flavor pops as it warms.
F- Medium bodied with some decent carbonation as well. Works well with the flavor. 
O- I'm assuming this is in the holy trinity of triples. (Ranked number 3) I liked it a lot, but I don't fully think it's something to write home about. A very solid and well made ale. Some sweet and savory buttery notes mixed together. I'd have it again for sure.Jul 17, 2021"

This beer has not been on my radar to consume. I have seen it time and time again at the beer stores, yet I have not picked it up. It is time to right that wrong today! I do not like a triple that is overbearing, yeasty, and malty, yet many I have consumed lean this way. I have a hard time discerning what is the perfect balance. This beer is eight months old. This is newer than what I have consumed in the past. The beer is 44 degrees and served in a chalice. A lively head, but average retention. The massive three-fingered bubbly, airy, and creamy bright white head left some lacing on the glass as it dissipated. The head dropped two finger lengths but maintained for a moment. I wanted the head to stay massive and leave an abundant lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 5, pale gold with amber yellow hues. The beer is somewhat cloudy with active carbonation. The appearance of the beer is average for this style. 

The initial aromas in the beer are banana, cloves, spicy phenols, and lightly toasted malts. Nosing further, I detect a floral bouquet, toasty bread, oranges, a touch herbal, a subtle fruity sweetness. 

The flavors in the beer are oranges, peppery, cloves, banana esters, phenolic, herbal, honey-like sweetness, lightly toasted malts, crackers, perfumey hops, and floral undertone. 

The mouthfeel of the beer is slightly warming with a high effervescent. 

The body of the beer is medium, medium-high carbonation, and fuller finish. 

I enjoy how beer starts off subtle, then slowly builds in flavor, and then a spicy peppery clove finish. The flavors of the beer are bright and contrasting. The malt in the beer is not overpowering but provides a firm backbone for this beer. I am honestly surprised by this beer. The beer is an excellent example of what a triple should be, disappointed I kept passing it up.Apr 30, 2021"
Westmalle Trappist Tripel,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,"11.2 oz. Bottle
4/20/21

A slightly white haze and orange tints inside the otherwise, golden liquid. Massive fluffy white and creamy foam cap goes on forever.

Yeasties funk aromas are sweet, tangy, tart, banana and cream dominated. 

Sharp and tangy yeast bite is metallic and dry. Malt seems a bit thick, lazy amber, medium feel, sweet taste. Dry, very dry, except for a long and slick maltiness feel. 

Boozy herbs and medicinal effects are a bit harsh, but certainly complex and unique. 

A classic of the style that I much respect for.Apr 21, 2021"
Westmalle Trappist Tripel,5.0,4.5,4.0,3.75,"Look: It pours golden with a white head. It has very good clarity. 

Smell: It has a strong aroma of spice up front. There are low levels of pepper and oranges with a bit of grainy sweetness. There is a very low banana note well in the background. 

Taste: It is very spicy with pepper being the strongest. There are clove notes as well. There are some orange notes and perfume like notes in the background. There is a grainy sweetness to it. 

Feel: It has a medium body with an extremely dry finish. 

Overall, a very good beer with plenty of flavor with the spices being a bit overbearing.Apr 09, 2021"
Westmalle Trappist Tripel,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Westmalle Tripel pours into my glass only slightly hazy, and a light polished gold in color. Head is rocky, bone white, and lasting.
On initial examination Westmalle Tripel's aroma is fragrant and perfumey in nature. Fruit esters are what I notice next. Specifically, I can smell ripe, juicy orange combined with hints of ripe pear. All this combines with what I can only describe as banana coupled with honey, fresh from the comb. Then comes this gentle spicy, peppery quality typical of so many great Belgian ales. What's impressive is how each aroma adds to a complex, delicious smelling aroma giving Westmalle Tripel an aroma that is complex, and delicate.
Westmalle Tripel's body is smooth, crisp, delicate, and lightly carbonated. The flavors follow the nose well except I do notice the presence of malt more here than I did on the nose. Those malt flavors start you off delicately grainy before moving into gentle alcoholic spiciness coupled with flavors of honey and ripe fruit esters. As with the nose those esters come out in the form of orange juice, pear, and banana following behind and lending support. The finish is peppery, dry, and lasting.
its easy to see why Westmalle Tripel is one of the world's great examples of the style. It's nothing short of delicious. Westmalle Tripel is delicious, complex, balanced, and yet the flavors are engaging, accessible, and not the least bit overpowering in nature.Mar 21, 2021"
Westmalle Trappist Tripel,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,"Poured from a 1 pint 9.4 ounce bottle into a tulip glass, bottled on 05 02015, best before end 2022/09/09.

APPEARANCE: pours a beautiful golden color with two fingers white head that slowly dissipated until a thin, broken layer of small bubbles remained, there are larger chunks of sediment suspended in this beer, moderate lacing, lighter carbonation.

SMELL: sweet honey, banana bread, cloves and wet hay.

TASTE: the taste follows the nose, sweet honey and banana bread then cloves and wet hay with a little farm house funk on the finish, the 9.5% ABV is very well disguised.

PALATE: medium body but too lightly carbonated for my liking, it's an older bottle so maybe that was the issue.

OVERALL: this is a terrific beer and absolutely scary how well the alcohol taste is masked, the only issue I have is it could have used more carbonation, I enjoyed the beer immensely even with this minor criticism, The bottle is six years old and that may have affected the carbonation, or maybe this particular batch had lower carbonation, in any event I would recommend this beer to anyone who likes the style and will most certainly buy it again.Mar 21, 2021"
Westmalle Trappist Tripel,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Slightly hazy medium gold, with one finger of white head, that leaves a ring, and a thin layer of surface coverage. No lacing. 

Smell is a moderately strong , yeasty mix of banana extract, light spiciness, and a bit of crackery malt that fades with the head. 

Taste is bread crust , a fruity flavor that is not-quite apple, (cooked) banana , very slight clove , and coriander+black pepper spiciness. Occasional brief flashes of barely-there , dried lemon. There is a solventy/liqueurish/alcoholic presence that all of the above is embedded within. Light bitterness , and a drying finish that lingers awhile. 

Feel is initially smooth, with very,very fine moderate carbonation that comes in mid-way . Drying finish.

Overall, thoroughly enjoyable , as always. A classic , for good reason.Feb 16, 2021"
Westmalle Trappist Tripel,4.5,4.5,3.75,3.25,"Nice and golden in colour, smell is sweet, yeasty and strong. Taste is yeasty, strong and slight spicy notes. You can defo taste the ABV and Belgium yeast.Feb 06, 2021"

Westmalle Trappist Tripel,4.25,4.5,4.75,3.75,"Have been exploring the local selection of Trappist beers. This is a good beer that has looks nice in a glass with a classic golden color body and a white head that leaves a nice lacing as it dissipates.

Westmalle Trappist Tripel,4.75,4.0,4.5,4.25,"slightly hazy gold body pours with an excited foam white head billowing with impossibly high retention that leaves curtains of sticky lacing behind as it settles at probably the slowest rate I've ever seen so far

aroma is Belgian yeast followed by banana bread malt - clove and coriander close behind of course

taste follows the nose. banana spice bread malt, funky with pear and honey background. bubblegum spats against the booze heat in the background

feel is higher carbonation, lighter body, slightly oily and smooth with a crisp dry finish. 

overall:
yeast takes the background of this Tripel but banana bread with spice hits nice in a traditional trip sense. clove and spices frontwards, pear and honey in the back.

Westmalle Trappist Tripel,4.5,4.75,3.0,4.0,"Look: Golden, hazy, with a thin layer of sediment on the bottom. A LOT of white head, and it doesn't go away. Most of the content in glass is head.

Smell: This beer smells very malty.

Taste: Alcohol flavor is a bit too strong. Although it smells really malty, the alcohol taste is over-dominating, and it really takes the malt flavor away.

Feel: Medium-carbonation.Jan 03, 2021"
Westmalle Trappist Tripel,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,"Reviewing one of my favorite beers at long last. It pours a rich golden hue with decent head but doesn’t explode out of the bottle like other brews of this ilk. The aroma from the top of this cool bottle is banana, clove, with some funk. The taste is banana, clove funk, pear with a tiny alcohol burn. This is a strong beer but so damn drinkable and that makes it a dangerous beer as so many of the Belgians are. A little pricey but worth it, and this has a bottled on Nov 2019 and good till Nov 2021 and I’ve had these near fresh from a friends brother that brought it over from there but this is holding up well with no discernible loss of flavor though I am operating on my always suspect memory, cheers!Jan 01, 2021"
Westmalle Trappist Tripel,5.0,4.5,4.75,4.25,"Poured from a 330ml bottle into a small kronenbourg glass.
Look: pours light golden with a large fluffy white head that persists for quite a while. An exceptionally pretty beer with the typical vigourous and aggressive carbonation of Belgian ales rushing right up.
Smell: Yeasty, sweet banana bread. Delightful but mellow.
Taste: Sweet yeasty, banana flavour, very much a beer that isn't intimidatingly strong in flavour, instead pleasantly balanced.
Feel: Full Bodied and drinks like it had half the alcohol content it does, no alcohol noticeable whatsoever, which is impressive for 9.5%.
Overall: A wonderful beer. Best Trappist I've ever had.Dec 25, 2020"

T - cloves and bananas on the nose, followed by a nice bit of belgian yeast
F - heavy carbonation, medium mouthfeel, there is a slight booziness to the beer
O - nice beer for the style, the yeast flavor isn't overbearing
Second bottle drank 7/4/21

Taste follows nose with sweetness up front, a bit sugary, then a bit of the banana, clove, and berries in the middle, it remains sweet throughout but finishes with some alcohol punch in the end. Mouthfeel is medium and soft with a light carbonation. Overall, this is excellent and sets the bar high for other tripels.Dec 06, 2020"
Westmalle Trappist Tripel,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A - Restrained pour into a chalice producing a cloudy yellow straw unfiltered brew sporting a 1"" finger ivory head. Moderate carbonation.

S - Yeast, bread, clove, juniper, banana,

T - Spicy bite, yeast, banana, clove. Bitter. 

M - Heavy. Full bodied. Medium viscosity. Crisp but lingering. 

D - Lots of characteristics of a hefeweizen on this one. The banana and the clove notes are present in ample quality but lacking the sweetness of a traditional hefe. In addition, qualities of an IPA are present in terms of the hoppy bite, though subtracting floral qualities. Fantastic.Nov 30, 2020"

9.5% abv, into Westmalle Chalis, almost clear - a bit murky, with soft yeast esters and mellow malt with a soapy white head which quickly settles into a white cap ring...sediment/yeast cake on the bottle's bottom...

On the nose, fruity subtle yeast with a solid malt backbone.

On the mouth, light and effervescent - past its prime, for those that like young ageable beer, but for those that like older mature ageable beer, this is a real treat that is not meant to be rushed, rather savored as one contemplates its many unique facets...

Slight warming on the way down...

Westmalle Trappist Tripel,4.25,3.5,4.0,3.75,"Appearance: Hazy gold, good, thick head.

Smell: Toast, cloves, hint of fruit. Not very aromatic.

Taste: Fruity, boozy, sweet, very carbonated, herbal. Sweetness gets stronger as it warms up. Pretty complex.

Overall: I used to be really big on tripels when I first got into craft beer. I never got around to trying this one until now. It's a pleasant and complex beer, sweet but not too sweet, balanced with some herbal notes.Nov 01, 2020"
Tooheys New,2.5,2.5,2.25,2.5,"Tooheys New. The pride of New South Wales. ANother mainstream Aussie adjunct lager, it's a NSW icon, much like VB is to Victoria, XXXX Queensland, Emu Export to WA and West End to SA. It's not something i've had in a while, as previously I found it too sweet for my liking. But let's give it a fair crack...

Look: Standard Aussie Macro lager. Deep Golden Straw, filtered, highly carbonated. Head was non existent and has faded to a thin foam on top. Lots of cascading bubbles rising to the top. Standard stuff. 

Smell: Wet grassy hops, from the standard Pride of Ringwood hops, which also gives a slight sour lemon/citrus nose, pale malt sweetness. Smells like an Aussie adjunct lager 

Taste: Heavy biscuit malt and grain flavour throughout the sip, a tiny fizz of bitterness towards the end with a slight citrus twang. Pretty clean and smooth. Carbonation is heavy, and takes over the flavour of the beer quickly. 

Feel: Highly carbonated, so refreshing when drunk ice cold. It's clean, easy drinking especially if you're just after something to drink without thinking about complex flavours. 

Overall: it's better than what I remember from my young adult days of drinking this stuff because it was one of the cheaper options on the market, but it's pretty bland to be honest. There's not a lot going on flavour profile wise, and the heavy carbonation does not assist in keeping the flavours around. Having said that, you need to drink this ice cold - much like VB as once it warms up it starts to turn proper funky. A decent enough lager to quaff quickly on a hot summers day,Aug 25, 2021"
Tooheys New,3.25,2.75,3.0,3.0,"Pours pale golden with plenty of carbonation rising. Decent 1 finger head that has good lasting power.

Aroma of corn, light malt and slightly bready.

Taste is of light malt, corn, and somewhat grassy. Rather sweet. Tastes better than expected (expectations were low).

Mouthfeel is light body and lightly cleansing. Somewhat dry in the mouth.

Overall, a decent hot weather beer. Maybe slightly better for the style than most. Still, nothing to get too excited about.Jan 02, 2020"
Tooheys New,3.75,3.0,3.0,2.5,"Gold in color with a half inch of off white covering the top. The aroma is of corn and that’s it. I’m tasting some corn and light malt. There’s a trace of grassy hops. The mouth is highly quaffable and thin.May 04, 2019"
Tooheys New,3.25,3.25,3.25,3.25,"From can, pours Amber with thin white head which fades away very quickly. Aroma of grain, hops. Taste is some malts and a little hop bitterness. Not to bad.Dec 03, 2015"
Tooheys New,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.5,"Format: a mid-brown 375mL stubby with the age-old Tooheys New macro label.

Appearance: a solid amber in colour with plenty of chunky macro lager carbonation. A finger of white head drops to a thick cap. Sporadic lacing.

Aroma: an aroma of proper grain (rather than cheap grain and adjuncts). Better than most macro lagers.

Taste: again a touch better with those same flavours - Tooheys New surprises me a little whenever I have it (which is rare). There is a reason why this and VB are two of the most-bought macro lagers in the country.

Aftertaste: more grains and husk here with the slightest touch of hop bitterness. Some sweetness too from indistinct origins.

Mouth feel: moderate in feel with a higher carbonation to bring through that fantastically refreshing crispness.

Overall: Tooheys New continues to surprise me when I occasionally drink it. It is one of the standard Aussie macro lagers, but there is a reason it is one of the mainstays in Australian pubs. It is a definite cut above most standard cheap macro lagers, and decent at AU$45 for a case of 24 x 375mL stubbies. Most importantly, one of my favourite pub beers wouldn't be an option without New (a 50/50 - or Black n Tan for you Americans - with half Tooheys Old and half Tooheys New).Dec 16, 2014"
Tooheys New,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,"Pretty grim. Looks a lot better than it tastes, but that's not saying much, believe me.

Tooheys New,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,"As a young, uninitiated whipper-snapper, this was my go-to beer, with the airwaves and pub signs enjoying marketing saturation from the Tooheys behemoth. This beer is a macro beer, no excuses offered. It is structured to move great volume at the expense of flavor, smell and texture. At least it’s cheap as chips, but you get what you pay for.

Tooheys New,2.0,1.5,2.5,2.0,"Another in my self-imposed torture of reviewing Aussie lagers, when will it end!? (I did buy a bottle of Chimay White which I cannot wait to review). Anyway this one has always been an option when the only other thing on tap is Carlton Draught or VB, and only because the on tap version is -0.4 degrees Celsius, which means you can't even taste how bad it is.

Poured from a 375ml stubbie into a 500ml Pokal.

A: Body on the yellow side of gold, with a cappuccino foam white head that dissolved quicker than a Disprin to leave a ""spider web"" lacing.

S: Smells of musty grains and skunky vegetables. No detectable hop aroma. There is a hint of the damp sewer rat that was noted in my tasting of the VB, lets hope this doesn't present below.

T: Yep... almost as bad as the VB. There's really not too much betwixt them; annoyingly heavy ""bad"" malt grains (yes, as opposed to good malt grains, there is a difference), with that bad vegetable flavour and in this one more than VB I noticed something chemical tasting (???). If the hops are there I don't like what they are doing to the flavour profile.

M: Over carbonated to the point of ""dreaded bloat"" as I like to call it. I couldn't finish more than three of these before I called it a night. It is different on tap, but this is a bottle review, I may do a tap review later. Also watery... again common in Aussie lagers.

D: If I wasn't reviewing it I wouldn't have bought it. Lucky I only bought a single stubbie and I've got something else to drink so I can simply tip the rest down the sink. On another note; it's positive to see craft beers taking off in this country as we have suffered so long under the yolk of macro brewers and I really think Australians deserve a decent beer choice - VIVA CRAFT BEERS!

Food match: The cheapest meat pie you can find... don't forget to completely drench it in tomato sauce to completely drown out the flavour of this brew.Sep 08, 2011"
Tooheys New,3.5,2.5,2.0,2.5,"Dark golden to light amber, fluffy finger sized head with okay retention.

A sweet blandness about the smell with lots of grain & corn with faint hops.

Skunky, bland tasting beer. Other than some corn, bread and some syrup there wasn't much else of note coming forward in this beer. It had a mild bitter finish & is too skunky. It's light bodied & almost water like. Crisp & dry in the finish.

This one was a struggle to finish & if not for the blandness of it I probably wouldn't have. Australian lager has a lot to answer for.

The reason for this review? My good mate Spud (name changed in case of retaliation threats) bought me a schooner down the local RSL thinking that was what I drank. Bless him. (For he hath sinned).

Ok - it looks like bland beer, it's Aussie Beer colour, it has a small head, and it's BLOODY COLD. Served at 0.6 degrees, mon derriere.... So funnily enough it doesn't smell of anything. Even a polar bear's fart wouldn't smell of anything at that temperature. And I ain't gonna stand in the RSL sniffing away because quite clearly my mates would think I was mistaking beer for glue.

Bland malt-driven taste, and the usual metallic aftertaste. it is refreshing. In summer, of course, not winter.

Tooheys New,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,"Pours the standard golden yellow with a bubbly white head that laces and retains moderately well. Aroma is what you would expect from the style -- a relatively weak grain smell with, for whatever reason, definite hints of metal. Taste mimics the smell with a mild grain sweetness that fades into slightly bitter hop notes. Body is light and carbonation is high.

Drinkability is fine if you want a very light beer that holds off on flavor. This combined with the low ABV means you could put back several on a hot day, but I wouldn't recommend it on anything beyond it's refreshing qualities.

A: Perfectly clear golden, with larger rising bubbles but a miniscule head that never really covers. Whitish gauze topping remains in a crescent-shaped topping, carbonation breaking the surface here and there.

S: Grainy sweetness, corn-pops and such. Flowery, honeyed and all the appropriate smells. Not as brazenly sugary or 'adjunct-y', but still pretty bland to these nostrils.

T: Not nearly so sweet as I might have figured, based only on aroma. Bready (something like a saltine cracker?), with a fair tang of greens (vague hops) and a touch of pepper-dry spice.

M: Nice and crisp. Light feel but with some backing, a spicy-bitter zest that holds a long while. A healthy carbonation, springy without overexertion. 

D: After a sip or two, Tooheys New began to grow on me; for a lager of its ilk, it's not bad at all. Refreshing and 'bright', airy and flavorful enough - for $1.59 a bottle I could do worse...much worse. Worth a try.Jan 26, 2010"
Baltika #3 Classic,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,"00 ml bottle, from Løvbjerg, Ikast. ABV is 7.0%. Black colour, ruby in the highlights. Large beige head. The aroma is bready and moderately roasty, some fruity hints too. Pleasant and smooth flavour of moderately roasted malts, black bread, mild coffee, chocolate and caramel, but not too sweet. Very moderate hops. A beer I might well buy again.Apr 19, 2021"
Baltika #3 Classic,4.5,4.25,4.0,4.0,"Very dark brown, with no light leaking through. 2+ fingers of finely-textured tan head.

Smell is brownie batter, but slightly less sweet, a little cola, and some roasty malt aroma.

Taste is roasted nuts, cola, brown bread, and slight earthy char. Light , pleasant bitterness. A slight woody note as it warms. 

Feel is light-side of-medium, with light, very fine carbonation tingle. Drying finish. 

Overall, a good, basic Baltic porter . I wish it had slightly more carbonation, but that's a minor point. Best By date is 6/20/20 , but it's still good.(Bottling date : 6/20/19) If I think to look at it, I'd definitely try it again, younger.

The taste is semisweet tangy roasted malt with more dark fruit and dark chocolate. The finish reveals a little caramel and closes with mild bitterness. The mouthfeel is watery, although it approaches medium body, with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Overall, good. The watery taste & feel are a disadvantage for this beer.

Baltika #3 Classic,3.75,3.75,4.0,3.5,"Poured from a pint bottle into a snifter glass
Appearance – The beer pours a deep brown color with a one finger head of off-white foam. The head has a decent level of retention, fading over time to leave a small amount of streaky and foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is very strong of a roasted malt mixed with a good deal of caramel sweetness and a little bit of a char aroma. Along with these smells comes some lighter notes of cocoa and a touch of vanilla.
Taste – The taste begins with a very malty roasty taste that has a little bit of a caramel and vanilla sweetness upfront. As the taste advances the roastiness stays very strong, while the sweet fades a bit. At the same time there is a woody and earthy flavor that begin to develop with a touch of a molasses joining in as well recovering a bit of the caramel and vanilla loss. At the very end a hint of alcohol and a decent hit of char hits the taste buds, leaving one with a nice dark and roasty taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is somewhat on the thinner side in terms of thickness and chewiness for a 7.0 % abv porter, with a carbonation level that is rather average. A tad more thickness and a bit less carbonation may have been slightly more appropriate for the style and the roasty/slightly boozy/drier toasted tastes of the brew, but overall rather decent.
Overall – A nice example of a very roasty and somewhat drier finishing porter. Not over the top of chocolate and caramel/molasses like may porters. Quite balanced and easy drinking.May 07, 2020"

Baltika #3 Classic,3.75,3.5,4.0,3.25,"Just a quick review of my first beer from Baltika (Балтика). Poured into a standard pint glass from a 1 pint, .9oz bottle.

Look: very dark brown, almost black. Very small head of off white foam. Quickly dissipating lace.
Smell: Molasses and caramel malt dominate the smell. Slight nuttiness / breadiness in the finish.
Taste: Dominant molasses again, even balance of caramel malt. Very similar to the non-alcoholic beverage Malta Goya, which is brewed with barley and hops like beer, but with a very recognizable caramel flavor profile balanced by molasses. Surprisingly fruity flavors linger, similar to dried apricots.
Feel: light body, medium carbonation, slightly sticky but smooth.

Overall a pretty good porter! I think my perception is slightly skewed by that Malta agota beverage that I drank so much as a kid. Not the best, but a very drinkable porter.Apr 02, 2017"

T: palate starts nutty, malty sweet with dark dried fruit and soft alcohol. As it warms, figs come out more with light toffee notes and a hint of plum. Hop flavor and bitterness are medium low. There is nothing harsh or burnt. The balance is to the malt.

Original Pils,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"It would be an interesting taste test to see if one can tell much difference between various examples of this style. Most of them from Germany are pretty similar, and OK. American ones vary more, I think, with some being very good and some very bad. But a test would be interesting (ain't gonna happen though).

This one is nice and clear and yellow with fair fizz. The aroma is weak but clean. The taste is simple and slightly sweet, with almost no bittering. The finish is very clean. This would be a very easy drinking brew - you could drink these all day and not get dehydrated.

Taste is nicely hoppy with a solid grain/bread backing. Slightly sweet. The middle brings a slight mineral taste, with some bittering continuing into the finish and fading in the aftertaste. The finish is crisp and dry with the mineral flavor lingering.

Original Pils,3.0,3.25,3.25,3.5,"An acceptable beer to wash down a makeshift lunch. I won't repeat the beer. 
To pair with the Bavarian-dominated Kalea Advent Calendar from Costco, lunch was a Costco veggie burger with a mustard seed spread. That spice made up for the bland beer and average burger.

I noticed that Egerer is the brewer of perhaps seven beers in the Kalea case. A couple of those, Egerer probably bought the brand. But for the Rheder pils, Egerer seems to be the contract brewer. (Probably for convenience to export and brewing regulations.) I went on Schlossbrauerei's website and they seem to be a Bavarian estate of landed gentry. Hence I'm not too surprised by the conservative beer. I also couldn't find the English button and lost patience after five minutes. Schloss has several recipes and beverages. Curious that this is the only one rated on BA. (Kalea marketing.)

Original Pils,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.25,"$ 2.50 (Including tax)/500 mL can ($0.148/oz) from Costco, Schertz, TX. Part of the Costco 2019 Advent Calendar. Reviewed 11/12/19.
Can dated “EXP 05/2021”. Stored on the shelf at the store, stored at home at 42 degrees and served at 42 degrees in a hand washed and dried 0.5L pilsner glass.
Appearance – 4.
First pour – Light yellow, clear.
Body – Light yellow, clear.
Head – Large (Maximum 14 cm, aggressive center pour), white, high density, average retention, diminishing to a three to five mm crown that actually looks like a crown and thick complete cap. Some three-dimensional lace curtains remain as the head retracts.
Lacing – Excellent! Very jagged three-dimensional bands of torn lace curtains. See also above.
Aroma – 3 – Slightly sweet and grainy, no hops.
Flavor – 3.5 – Moderately bitter and crisp. No grain or malt flavors, just some light hops and a touch of dimethylsulfide. No alcohol (4.7 % ABV as marked on the can) flavor or aroma, no diacetyl. 
Palate – 3.25 – Light, watery, soft carbonation. 
Final impression and summation: 3.5 - Surprising tasty, at least to my palate. Although not a particularly well-made pilsner, it is unobtrusive and would go well with a bahnhof machine meal.Nov 12, 2019"

The taste is pils malt, more grassy and barely floral hops along with some mineral taste before a moderately bitter finish. The mouthfeel is thin bodied, adequately carbonated and dry in the finish.

Original Pils,4.0,3.75,4.0,4.0,"Poured from a can into a pint glass
Appearance- The beer pours a clear golden amber color with a big billowy head of white foam. The head has a great level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a ton of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is rather strong of a grainy and caramel aroma mixed with a little bit of grass. Along with these smells comes a touch of paper sand a hint of herb.
Taste – The taste begins with a crisp grainy cracker flavor that has a touch of caramel sweetness. There flavors create a base and remain strong throughout the taste of the brew. As the taste moves forward from the front there is more and more dank tastes that develop, with some pine and grass, but a rather decent (for a pils at least) herbal taste coming to the tongue. A touch of sweet corn and more cereal malt come to the tongue at the very end, leaving one with a rather robust and quite enjoyably flavorful more dank (for a pils) and cereal taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is medium to slightly thinner while the carbonation level is high. The feel was awesome for the brew overall and make for one easy drinker at 4.7 % abv, even in light of its somewhat “bigger” flavor profile for the abv and style. 
Overall – This pils really packs it in!!! It is low in abv., big in cereal and malt, and decently dank hopped all while being not too overly sweet. This is a fantastic more session like pils. I am impressed by this one!!Oct 11, 2019"
Original Pils,3.0,2.5,2.25,2.25,"CAN: 500ml pull-tab. Black and gold label. 

""Pils."" 4.7% ABV.

Mineral-laden, which distracts. Cheap 6-row pale malt and pilsner malt dominate this simple (if not rudimentary) brew, with a generic sweetness taking centre stage. Lacks any Noble hop flavour whatsoever.

Soft, smooth, wet, medium-bodied. Should be lighter-bodied and refreshing, not to mention cleaner drinking and more crisp.

Overall, it's a drinkable attempt at a pilsner that feels more like a European (all malt) pale lager marketed as a pilsner. I'd sooner drink any widely distributed better known German pilsner (e.g. Warsteiner), and I find the absence of any Noble hop character whatsoever appalling. Too sweet, rendering it imbalanced. Doesn't even showcase fresh pilsner malt well...has a decidedly aged taste to it...I'd feel bad marking it down for that, but then the brewers knew it'd be included in a holiday advent calendar box and here I am drinking it 2 months *before* it was advised to do so...

Original Pils,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,"500ml can - another refugee from the Craft Beer German Advent calendar from a few months back.

This beer pours a clear, pale golden yellow colour, with three fingers of puffy, loosely foamy, and bubbly eggshell white head, which leaves some decent random cloud-form pattern lace around the glass as it lazily sinks out of sight.

It smells of gritty and grainy cereal malt, a bit of generic pome fruitiness, wet sulfur, and some tame earthy, musty, and grassy green hop bitters. The taste is grainy and crackery pale malt, faint baked red apples, a touch of gasohol, and more understated grassy, herbal, and dead floral hoppiness.

The carbonation is quite active in its palate-taunting frothiness, the body a solid medium weight, and mostly smooth, with nothing really a cause for concern at this point in the game. It finishes trending dry, the crackery malt and hops working in lingering tandem.

Overall - this comes off as more or less a prototypical version of the style, simple, and easy enough to put back. I don't know why they would make a Christmas beer box out of stuff like this, but I guess not everyone is enamoured with big stouts and spiced Belgian brews, eh?Feb 01, 2019"

Smell: Traditional hops aroma with some hints of sweetness. Mild and in no way overpowering.

Taste: Light and sweet with a clean crisp finish. Nothing to remarkable. Standard fare for a pilsner. Not too exciting but sessionable.

Feel: Light and airy, no real weight or lingering mouth feel.

The taste is predominately pale notes with some cracker/grain underneath. The mouthfeel is very light and creamy, with a medium low carbonation level.

Original Pils,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Appearance: Medium golden color, with some haze. The head is snow-white, coarse, and modest, though it retains well. Fine-beaded lacing coats the glass walls. Numerous columns of fat bubbles rise to the surface, neither languid nor hurried in their pace. 

Aroma: Classic white bread and cracker note, with some grassy, clean hops. The aroma is very clean.

Taste: Begins with abundant pale malt, having white bread and cracker notes. Soon after, grassy and herbal hops dominate, the latter being more pronounced. As the taste progresses, the hops assume a sharp bitter, metallic note. Finishes with a lingering medicinal note.

Mouth feel: A touch thin, with a slight stinging carbonation.

Drinkability/notes: What more can I say, a well-made example of a revered, classic style. Certainly the equal of the excellent Czech Pilseners. 

Presentation: Packaged in a 500 ml, 16.9 ounce aluminum can, served in a standard Pilsener glass. Beer number one (December 1st) from the 2017 Costco Advent Beer Calendar.Dec 02, 2017"
Original Pils,4.5,3.5,3.0,3.25,"Pours a cloudy straw orange with three fingers of white head. Head formation is quick, with great retention and lacing. Aroma is pilsner and pale malts with herbal and floral hop notes. Straight forward ""beer"" aroma. Flavor profile is intriguing, with pilsner, pale, and bread malts opening it up. It develops a ""wet-dog"" note, before decaying into a bitter hop finish. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a slightly effervescent feel. Overall, a strong flavored pilsner that doesn't produce the best of notes. 

Served in a 12oz snifter from a 16oz can.Dec 02, 2017"
Original Pils,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Well it's December 1st so time to open 1st beer of the pack. Poured from can @ about 40-45 degrees and into a pokal glass:

L: clear golden straw body that seems quite thickening for a pilsner. Great body with bubbly body that laces the glass.

A: pure and fresh malty goodness

M: medium creamy goodness. Take a dip and let it swish around. Take tiny sips, enjoy! This is as good as pilsners get. It does go thin but it's almost like it melts in the mouth and nearly dissolves. No after taste. Super smooth.

T: creamy malt, grain, honey, barley, and lemon. Slightly bitter.

O: best pilsner ever had hands down. Don't understand the low reviews. Maybe was poured in wrong glass and/or served too cold? This is German beer brewed with purity law. Sure it's not some crazy craft beer fad but it's brilliantly brewed for a pilsner. To give low score is almost like what did you expect? Why buy? This is German beer they will all be quite similar.

Amarcord Volpina,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,"Note: I selected English Strong Ale as the style for this beer, due to the similarity in character.

A 330ml bottle with a BB of July 2012. Picked up some time back from Beeritz in Knaresborough. Described on the label as a double-malt beer; bottle conditioned. All the beers from this brewery seem to be named after characters from the film 'Amarcord'. Not quite sure what Volpina means, though I get the impression she's a woman who seduces men...

Poured into a straight pint glass. A coppery-amber hue with decent carbonation and faint hazy sediment. Yields a massive head of fluffy off-white foam that lasts for a few minutes before reducing to a surface layer. Aroma of sweet, fruity malt with notes of dried fruit, raisins, fruitcake, caramel, yeast esters and a considerable whiff of booze in the background.

Tastes of rich, fruity malt with a dry finish. Notes of dried fruit, caramel, earthy yeast esters, stewed hops and a hint of brown sugar. A solventy, alcoholic twang in the background. Restrained bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth, dry and full-bodied, with tingly carbonation and a slight spiciness. Mildly astringent. Aftertaste of fruity malt.

Quite nice - no world-beater but it certainly has character. A good, fruity malt flavour that hints at it's strength - although it would be smoother if the alcohol was less apparent. Good depth and a satisfying mouthfeel. Beats the hell out of Italian macro brews - grab one if you come across it.Jun 29, 2012"
Monteith's Summer Ale,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Clear golden color with a bit of white foam. Aroma has citrus fruits, ginger and some bready malts. Taste starts with ginger, a bit of lemon, mostly on the sweet side and some bitterness in the background that doesn't mix very well with the rest of the flavors. Medium body with low carbonation.

Monteith's Summer Ale,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,"A bit thin, watery and cheaply sweet. Good for a mellow choice, but there are much better summer ales. On the flip side, it's still summer here at the beach in Busan, South Korea.Sep 20, 2015"

Monteith's Summer Ale,3.0,2.75,2.0,2.5,"Format: standard 330mL brown bottle with a simple but stylish label.

Appearance: pours out a clear dark golden in body with a white half-centimetre head with limited lacing. Looks okay.

Aroma: ginger, honey and spices, but smells a bit cheap, like essence was used instead of proper ingredients.

Taste: plenty of ginger and citrus up front, but once again it tastes more like a syrup rather than a proper natural flavour. Pretty ordinary.
Update: had this again today (01/02/2015) and it was completely undrinkable. Poured it.

Aftertaste: the flavours are bitter and yet also a bit saccharin on the finish. Some dryness. A bit awkward.

Mouth feel: quite light in feel and with a moderate carbonation that makes it feel a bit flat.

Overall: don't bother. A reasonably cheap tasting summer ale - there are better beers for less - this is $55 a case.Dec 09, 2014"
Monteith's Summer Ale,2.5,2.5,4.0,2.5,"Found this beer in pub in Omarama, Otaga, NZ... while fly fishing in the MacKenzie Highlands

Totally parched and starving from a hard morning after working a river close to town... we headed to the Omarama Hotel for a pint and some lunch... and started with two pints of Monteith's Summer Ale

Didn't really pay much attention to the appearance... first priority was to get it down the hatch... after a few gulps... I began to appreciate what I was drinking. There was an unexpected explosion of flavor... citrus / lemon / ginger flavors that suited my dry mouth... went well with our fish and chips

In my rating... I compare this to mass production beers... VB, Carlton, Tooheys, Bud, Coors, etc

Perfect for a hot day... wish I could find some here in Nevada... would be great in the summerJan 10, 2014"

T: Taste of mild citrus , a light malt sweetness with some fruit and bit of spice. Mild bitterness and a dry finish. 

F: Light body, crisp, smooth and refreshing.

O: Nice beer to grab on a summer day.May 30, 2013"
Monteith's Summer Ale,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,"Pours amber with a large, quickly fading head.
Nose shows hefty ginger and what might be nutmeg? Pretty overpowering. Also a faint vegetal/herb-like character.
Some ginger notes as flavours, followed by weak sweet malt and vegetal notes. No bitterness results in a cloying finish.
Could use more carbonation to dry things out.Jan 30, 2012"
Monteith's Summer Ale,2.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,"Monteiths Summer Ale pours a radiant golden amber lets through plenty of light. Head is light and thin and disappears quickly. There is very little in the way of lacing as the glass quickly empties. Not a classic looking ale, but what would you expect with a beer designed for hot summer days?

The smell is a clear indication of the taste journey you will be taken on when drinking a summer ale. It’s all about the ginger initially – not quite as punch as a ginger ale where I actually recoil when the zing of the ginger hits my nasal cavity – but a definite dominance. There is also some sweet honey (Monteiths actually add Rata Honey) to the brew, as well as light citrus and spicy herbs.

The ginger is strongly evident again on the taste. It is dangerously close to overriding the other flavours, but there is just enough maltiness to let you know you are actually drinking beer. The honey is there again and the citrus becomes more clearly defined as orange zest. The herbal spices are still there on the taste as well – a very similar taste to cloves which is a good match for the orange and ginger. My major criticism is that although the rata honey flavour is great the whole taste is just too sweet to have more than a couple of these. When drinking Summer Ale I have often felt the urge to move to something bitterer and more refreshing

It’s a medium carbonated beer with a light body giving it a good balance for drinking over a sessionJan 13, 2012"
Monteith's Summer Ale,3.0,2.5,3.0,4.0,"Jumping across the pond to NZ to try a beer from an alright (just alright) brewery: Monteith's. These guys are like the Burleigh Brewing Co. (or vice versa) of NZ; they produce semi-interesting craft brews on an almost macro level. Anyhow Summer Ales have always seemed like a bad idea to me. They mix the ""heavy"" ale brewing techniques with things like honey, orange and lemon, when really ales go better with flavours like chocolate or caramel... nonetheless I will proceed to drink them, rant aside.

Poured from a 330ml bottle into a tulip pint glass.

A: This is a fairly average looking brew. Clear golden body with a white 0.5cm head that leaves a small amount of lacing in the glass.

S: Smells exactly like Bundaberg Ginger Beer! So yeah, gingery... No typical ""ale"" aromas (malt, hops, yeast) could be discerned because of the strong ginger note.

T: Tastes like Bundaberg Ginger Beer! (and no they aren't paying me to plug their product). The spicy ginger flavour is right up front, followed by the honey notes and then there is a mild hop bitterness at the end, but it's a ginger dominated show. I hope you like ginger (I was more of a Mary Ann man myself).

M: Nice and smooth, not heavy enough to be considered ""creamy"" like a Wheat Beer, but it's also not far off.

D: A drinkable brew? Quite, but with the prerequisite of liking ginger... a lot. Otherwise it's one of the more passable beers I've had of a style that is to me the uncle Fester of brewing styles; creepy and lonely. Yep that sums up Summer Ales for me; I want to love them, but they're just too weird to be lovable. Back to Pale Ales it is then.

Food match: Thai or Szechuan cuisine would be a good pairing with this beer.Sep 02, 2011"
Monteith's Summer Ale,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,"Touring through New Zealand by Motorcycle, this was the go to beer after a long hot day. The taste of ginger, honey and other unrecognizable spices, it is definitely a unique tasting beer, but is no where close to the same taste as other ""summer shandys"" or lemon soda beers. It is a mix between a ginger ale and a pale ale. Over all it is a great beer for hot summer days with unique taste.Aug 21, 2011"
Monteith's Summer Ale,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,"Here's a bolter.

Reminds me of a drink I had when I was a kid in England - Limeade and Lager - in cans, around 0.1% ABV it was. Sweet sweet sweet.

This is very similar - highly carbonated, golden yellow with a white head. Looks alright.

Aromas of honey, lemon or lime cordial and a sweet soft drink style taste to follow. No hops. None!

Grab from an ice bucket, thump it down quick and it would be mighty refreshing, but don't call it beer. No, really.May 26, 2011"
Monteith's Summer Ale,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,"Single bottle served with dinner at a Gold Coast restaurant.

Poured into a small, slightly chilled schooner glass. Pale amber, big bubbly head, decent retention on that.

Nose is spicy, with strong notes of ginger, lemon, orange and honey. Smells like an herbal tea one might have for a sore throat.

Sweet, spicy and with bold ginger and citrus flavors, with a mild herbal bitterness to the finish. Pleasant for a sip or two, but this brew because cloying and undrinkable after just a few moments. Just too much - pushing in to ginger beer territory. Mild carbonation, slightly greasy/oily feel. 

A brew that could have been quite pleasant if the defining notes had been turned down from eleven. Instead, it just tasted like a gingerbeer mixed with a pale lager. Cloying and tiresome. I only marked it above a 'D' because at least there was an attempt to do something different here.May 07, 2011"

Monteith's Summer Ale,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,"A - Deep saturated orange Gold. Very nice appearance. A soapy head which dissipates down quite quickly leaving no trace of any head. No lacing either. Light carbonation visible.

S - Strong ginger and spiced meet honey-like flavors. Orange peel spiciness and some mild maltiness. Little to no hop aroma.

T - Ginger and orange flavours dominate an underlying maltiness and very very low hop bitterness. 

M - Light and fine carbonation, thin but quite smooth. Overly so.

D - Alot of people are slamming this beer and it is very unconventional, granted but I have tried a few of these fusion, lime/ginger/lemon beers and they have been truly woefull, this is the best by far. Still If your expecting a Euro Pale Larger you will be very upset.Nov 13, 2010"
Monteith's Summer Ale,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,"I didn't even want to try this beer after the Radler Bier, but the bar tender in the brew pub insisted I try it, as it's apparently their best seller. The only difference between this and the Radler beer is that instead of Spite lemon/lime soda, this tasted like carbonated apple juice soda. Not sure which one was worse, but they were both the worst beers I tried on my trip to New Zealand.Mar 23, 2010"
Monteith's Summer Ale,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,"Enjoying a Summer ale on a very cold Winter evening. Ooh yeah.

Pours a burnished gold colour with large effervescent bubbling, but a disappointingly thin head for all its efforts. White in colour, thin crown, retains well but I'd like it thicker. Lacing is enjoyable, but fairly thin. Pretty average-looking, has a soft drink appearance.

Smells tangy, sweet and spicy. Hints of clove, banana and red apple on that. But actually smells a lot like mead, which I guess is the ""honey-spiced"" aspect. Nice smell, very pleasant. But not very beer-y at all.

Taste is also sweet and tangy with a slight carbonated flavour and a fermented honey kind of flavour on the mid. Hints of clove and cinnamon without any real bite, just the flavour of spice without the sensation. Feel is a little thin, with a little bit of a tingle at first that pretty much dies to leave none of that effervescence that I can see in the glass. 

Overall this is a beer with pleasant flavours, but it's very sweet and too hearty to call itself a Summer brew. I'd say this would drink better heated up on a chilly Winter evening (which is kind of what I'm doing with it) A bit sickly when it comes right down to it, unable to be drunk all the time. Not too bad though.Jul 13, 2009"
Monteith's Summer Ale,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Wow, I've always thought of myself as a beer snob but apparently I am way off base on this one. Monteith's Summer Ale is delicious. Perhaps it's a new summer and a new beer from the reviews that look like they might be from the last southern hemisphere summer? Anyway - sampled on tap, many times, at the Loading Ramp in Havelock North (that's Havelock Nth to the Kiwis, and Havelock Ninth?! for a little while to this dumb cowboy), Craft in the lovely city of Dunedin, and Monty's in Queenstown throughout February and March of 2009.

A: golden, crystal clear, in the pinty-like glasses on the North Island and the fluty-like glasses in the South. Great carbonation.

S: coriander? ginger? delicious? inviting? all of them

T: this is delicious, spicy and refreshing, the ginger comes through for me but backed up with enough malt and a smattering of hops that makes the ginger a strong bit player

M: it felt good in my mouth the second before I drank it. seriously, it was good.

D: are you kidding? coming from the land of double IPAs I could drink this all day, and I did - well, I probably drank more Original (that's another review). Absolutely delicious and unlike other summer beers, not at all cloying.

I thought the Summer was delicious. In fact, we brought 9 bottles home with us. Maybe it was just being in NZ - but I would defend this against many spring and summer beers I've had in the US. Thoroughly enjoyable.Apr 22, 2009"

T - Like a shit macro lager mixed with ginger beer (non-alcohol bundaberg) Some earthy, spice presence as well. Quite sweet.
M - Light to medium bodied with pretty high carbonation.
D - I'm not adverse to ginger beer but I'd rather mix bundaberg non alcoholic ginger beer with gin or vodka than drink this ever again. The VB like beer flavour just does not mix well with ginger.Dec 06, 2007"
Monteith's Summer Ale,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,"Years ago I had a Monteiths Black Ale and loved it so I was expecting good things from their other offerings. Alas...
The colour is an clear copper and there was a short-lived head but the aroma promised a very interesting drop. Ginger/cinnamon smell with a dash of lemon. In fact it smells like a good ol' shandy you'd give the kids or the missus once upon a time. The flavour is much the same but the ginger overwhelms the mix and is badly out of balance. The label says honey-spiced but the honey is lost in the mass of spicy ginger. The mouthfeel is near flat and lifeless so by the time you get half-way into the drink its like spicy stale piss. This could be a lot better with better balance and some spark. It seems Monteiths are mastering the anti-climax.Jun 21, 2007"
Monteith's Summer Ale,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,"A: Pours a pale golden color. Crystal clear with little head and no lace. Heavy carbonation. 
S: Ginger in spades. Little bit of honey hiding in there too.
T: Very sweet. Little bit of honey but way more ginger than anything else. The ginger dominates the aftertaste as well with the presence of some other spice(s) I cannot quit distinguish (nutmeg maybe?).
M: Syrupy in the same way fountain soda is. 
D: This tastes as much like ginger soda as it does beer. There might be a decent brew in there but they would need to cut back on the ginger in a big way to have any chance of finding it.Feb 23, 2007"

The tour guide actually said that this and the Radler were aimed at people that dont really like that beer flavor! Well done! Soda fizz carbonation, lively feel.Mar 03, 2006"
Monteith's Summer Ale,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,"Dark amber colour with almost no head. Quite a lot of carbonation. Low viscosity. Looks like a soft drink.

The nose is ginger. And more ginger. In actuality it's more like asian pickled ginger. It's got a bit of sweetness, but there's very little else outside the overpowering ginger. Very one-dimensional.

The taste is pretty bad. Initial taste of ginger again, backed up by a strong hit of wet yeast. It's unbalanced and quite unpleasant. Eh. Mouthfeel very lifeless and dull.

Quite a disappointing beer. You could make a much better spiced ale for summer, and this just doesn't deliver.Jan 07, 2006"
Monteith's Summer Ale,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,"Jeez! do you reckon it needed a tad more ginger? I was a little bit excited about this beer, a nice summer ale? could be good. I was let down.
Poured golden into the glass, with almost no head that disappeared very quickly. Smelt of ginger. More like a ginger beer soft drink, than an alcoholic ginger beer. Was too overpowering. There was nothing in the taste either, but ginger, and a huge horrible sweetness. The label says to ""try it ice-cold witha a wedge of orange or lime"", that would probably be the only way to detract from th flavour of the ginger. No honey flavours at all, no after taste, possibly a bit too over carbonated aswell.Sep 29, 2004"

Right away, you know this one is different by its label. This is a beer with smoked malts (rauchbier) and that pays dividends in tasting different than the rest. This is a fantastic marzen no doubt, combined with the best beer-smoke flavor in the world. The malts were on point, the sweetness was present but tamed, and the carbonation really helped everything pop. The only complaint I have is a rather thin mouthfeel, but that's not uncharacteristic for the style. If you can find this one within 50 miles of you, go get it. It's that good. Prost!Aug 18, 2021"

A: Pours crystal clear, caramel colored as it rests, shades of ruby and amber when held to light. Large dense light khaki colored head with great retention and some lacing. 4.5

S: Huge smoky char up front, more subtle sweet malt backbone on the finish of the nose. Herbal herbaceous notes, subtle caramel, some Nobel-type hop spice. Wonderful nose. 4.25

T: Taste is much more muted as a whole, even the smoky notes are somewhat subtle. There’s an indiscriminate bitterness, raw oaky notes, a bit of toasted malts. Not bad but rather bland. 3.5

M: Medium bodied, high but not negatively so carbonation, drinkability is average. 3.75

T: Pretty big disappointment, not the typical quality of the other Aecht beers I’ve had. I’m afraid this may be an old bottle (was just purchased yesterday and had not seen it available at the beer stores the prior time I was there so I was hopefully this was this years vintage); regardless no way to tell without any bottling dates.

Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,"A big 500ml bottle with a very nice vintage label, you’d think you’re back in the movie “The name of the Rose” and enjoying a monks beer…

5,1% ABV. Pours a dark amber color and leaves a two inches brownish head.

On the nose, the beer smells like smoked malt or even meat, no different than other smoked beer but has something unique about it. Chestnut and brown sugar.

On the palate and following the nose, an incredibly tasty balance of smoked malt, chestnut, salty ham, sweet caramel and some herbal notes. Super tasty.

This is a thick bodied smoked beer, going down smoothly with moderate carbonation.

Overall, by far the best German bier I’ve ever had in my life. We aren’t so lucky regarding distribution of German beers here despite the proximity of Germany. This one was found at the beer store for 7€ price is a bit too much but I’m not complaining at all. Money well spent and I think I should purchase more smoked beer, and German ones particularly when I’ll get the chance again.

O- Arguably pretty much everything begins and ends with the major smoke aspect. That said as long as you're ok with that then it's a different and pleasant beer. I'm unlikely to wish to buy such a beer again but would happily drink one out and about now and again.
Review/scoring all done, now the reveal, I get to read the lables to see what I missed! ABV 5.1% vs 5.4% in the headers, but it states above also that the ABV% varies year to year...

Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.25,"I'm in Canada and I still have close neighbours who burn firewood to keep warm in the winter. Don't know why I picked it up except for an experiment. 
You can tell the beer is well crafted. Silky rich mouthfeel, bright light bitterness, nice colour, and a big smoke taste. Reminds me of my neighbours smoky chimneys in the winter, 
But , there are days when I can't take the smoke anymore, and with this beer, it was at about the 60% consumed point. so I salute the makers, but unlikely to try again. Too bad as the underlying beer seems like a great brew. A little lime dessert washed the lingering flavour away.May 15, 2021"
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,"This is one of many beers in their line that I've wanted to try for a very long time. It's always nice to find Rauchbiers as they're pretty much a dying style, so to find one that's the 3rd highest ranked of the style is really awesome. LEt's see what this one is all about

Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of tan head than quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

The nose is typical for a general smoked beer, but it has a nice depth to it. I'm picking up on aromas of smoked meat, chocolate malt, lightly acidic coffee, toasted brown bread, and brown sugar

For as smoke driven as this in aroma, this is wonderfully balanced in taste. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting caramel malt, salty ham, smoked wood, and lightly earthy hops. The swallow brings notes of smoked malt, brown bread, salty ham, caramel sweetness, herbal hops, and a touch of coffee

A light medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth and rich beer. Finishes dry and smoky with a great balance

Awesome beer right here. Insanely sessionable for the flavor, I could drink a lot of this in the cold weatherMay 12, 2021"
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen,4.5,4.25,4.0,3.75,"Before any other sensation is felt, the nose picks up a smokey aroma. That was just from popping the cap of a brown 16.9 ounce bottle. Now that most of the brew is snugly inside a clear Imperial pint glass, the visual can be observed. It's a beer deep dark brown with a reddish hue. For the depth of color, there is some transparency. The proper head is biege and quite enduring. The ""smoke"" becomes even more noticeable. Like an overly peaty Scottish Whiskey, the sensation is unique, but somewhat overwhelming. One is delightfully unique, but the one-trick aspect becomes almost annoying by the end of the serving. What else is there? Some nice glass lacing. The body is malty, but not too sweet. There may be hops in there, too, as there's some slight bitterness. Even with the maltiness, it's a bit light on the tongue, except for the smoke. The carbonation seemed just about perfect.Apr 20, 2021"
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen,4.5,2.75,2.75,2.75,"Old rating. (500 ml bottle). Well, any idiot can recognize that this beer has MORE aroma than (nearly) any other beer, and MORE flavour than a lot of beers. But to make a 100% honest rating, I have to ask myself: Do I actually LIKE the overpowering smell of smoked meat? Sadly, the answer is NO. I'm a beer drinker, not a goddamn sausage maker! The flavour is not quite as overpowering smoky as the aroma - at least you get a notion that you're drinking a beer and not just liquid smoked meat. Still, it tastes like something that has just been saved out of the burnt-out ruins of a brewery. Like any Marzen, it is quite light bodied (when you try to ignore the smokiness, of course). I probably have to admit that Rauchbiers are not my cup of tea - sorry, beer - but would still like to sample the Urbock as I imagine that a heavier beer would carry the smokiness better than a Marzen. Did I mention that this beer at least LOOKS good? - good head, beautiful dark copper colour.Jan 20, 2021"

Taste: Smoky flavour is very dominant. That smoky flavour actually doesn’t go away from your mouth for a long time. It’s like drinking smoked bread. But it lacks some other aroma in my opinion. A little bit sour.

Feel: light-body. Just enough carbonation. Smoky feeling doesn’t go away.

Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen,5.0,4.25,4.25,3.5,"Pours a dark brown with frothy light tan head. Straight campfire smoke on the nose. There's a lot of smokeyness to digest, as you'd expect. A touch of bacony, hammy meat, some campfire. I don't feel like the amount of smoked has enough malt to stand up to it. Like I think a little biscuity body to handle all of this smoked malt would be positively wonderful. Also, I am not getting any Marzen characteristics in the slightest, not that I was expecting any.

Nose is predominantly beechwood smoke, but underneath there are sweeter notes of roasted malt. The smoke flavor comes forward on the palate, but it's not as savory and intense as with their Festenbier. The smoke flavor is subtly balanced by the roasted malts and some hop bitterness, and the finish is surprisingly dry. Mouthfeel is excellent - full, moderate carbonation, but extremely refreshing.

The look is great, nice dark color, great head.
The flavor follows the aroma, like smoked licorice, if that’s a thing.
But for me, the smokiness is overwhelming. It never backs down. I found it to be acrid and and bitter and it also has an off putting medicinal taste. This beer gets points for being different, in my limited experience, but I don’t think I could finish more than one.Oct 07, 2020"

Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen,5.0,4.25,4.75,4.5,"Pint bottle poured into tulip. Appears black in color away from the light. When held to the light, only a slightly purple glow diffuses through. Head is thin. Finger width before dissipating fairly rapidly, although the carbonation remains persistent. Smell does not indicate what is in store flavorwise necessarily. Fairly mellow aroma of smokiness emitted from the glass. Very subdued smell. Flavor is remarkable, but not very complex. Very straightforward flavor by my estimation. The malty sweetness subtly rings through the more prevalent smoky flavor at first. The flavor eludes concise description, but evokes a lot of fine memories. I guess I would classify it like a charred pork chop flavor. It almost tricks your brain into tasting salt. Finishes with a hint of black cavendish tobacco. Aftertaste is like you just smoked a puff of a cigar or pipe. I think what makes this particularly enjoyable is the sensory experience reminds you of a lot things you've enjoyed that were smoky. A pork chop at the state fair. Morning bacon with your dad. A camp fire with friends. Maybe the sentimentality clouds the actual quality of the beer. I can't really say, but all I know is I love drinking this beer. It just makes you feel incredibly decadent and at the same time ""zuhause"" as the Germans would say.

500ml bottle served in a big crystal mug. Can't find a date on it. Bought it at Malt & Vine on Monday.

Pours a dark brown, moderately translucent, with a big light tan head. Smell is smoke, barley tea, toffee.

Taste is smokey in the aftertaste, toffee or burnt caramel in front. Moderate barley sweetness. Little bit of a brown ale vibe to it - kind of nutty or tea like. I get more smoke in subsequent sips.

Mouthfeel is not too heavy, but a little sticky. Overall, it's pretty good.Jul 25, 2020"
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen,4.5,5.0,4.75,4.75,"I haven’t had a smoked beer before but I must admit that I like smoked things, barbecue, smoked meat, smoked cheese cetera. I just like the smell of burnt wood, just like incense.
This one struck me, it reminded me of Austria or Germany, those places back in Europe, in the mountains where they burn wood to smoke meat. This one had a very similar scent to it, I guess it must have been smoked with birch.
The aroma is just totally smoked, I could very faintly sense any beer in there but the smoke was tremendous, I loved it. Actually, I did smell malts in there, roasted I guess, made me feel ever so slightly like a stout but it was much more than that. The smoke was overwhelming and I really loved it. It was like German smoked meat, pork or beef? Nostalgic.
The taste was even more surprising, as I didn’t expect the smoke to be this intensive - but it was, and besides being a beer, it was really “smoked” as in food is. It was sunken into the taste deeper than just the surface, it was a part of the whole thing. And the smoke had such a boquet that I love so I just couldn’t get enough of it.
The beer, although being a marzen, the mouthfeel reminded me of it and the underlying taste had more body than a lager but not as much as a bock, not even as much as a dark lager, nor an alt, it was definitely a marzen - and when in Germany, you have to be thinking in German beers so... This came in different varieties but I came marzen because I like this style best and I believe I made a good choice. Would be great to try a few others too!Jun 05, 2020"

Very nice head, with big bubbles, medium duration and good retention. Medium to high carbonation. 

Smell is fruity. Apple like. A bit alcoholic with hints yeasty, maybe.

The flavor is, as in many belgians, rather sweet. Apple like, yeasty and a bit bready. The alcohol is there too, normal for its 8%. Nice hoppy finish, soft and dry biterness at the end.

For a tripel, i found this rather refreshing.

Floreffe Triple,3.75,4.0,4.0,3.75,"Poured badly into a Karmaleit tulip glass.....eeeeek the explosion of foam was complete amateur.

It settled to a reasonable head, but quickly dissipated into a dishwater film, a bit disappointing.

Getting the nose in there and a malty, boozy wave hits you, not as expected.

Taste is sharp, sweet, and full of malt. Despite it's name, there is no sign of flora with this brew. You'll be greeted with a fizzy toffee type sensation, which does leave a 'come back for more' film on the tongue.

Feel is ok, a little artificial, and after that decent taste sensation, your mouth does dry up pretty quickly.

Floreffe Triple,5.0,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Pours a great frothy head. Nose is a little sourness and yeast. Taste is very clean, a little heat but not bad for 8%. Very light mouthfeel makes this an easy drinker. Finish is dry and clean.Jun 20, 2016"
Floreffe Triple,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,"When I popped the cork on Floreffe Triple I wasn't expecting something quite so dark; this dusky orange beer still allows some transparency but it's certainly not clear and, away from the light, looks downright muddied. The head, however, is true to form: creamy, rocky, long-lasting and lace supplying. 

Simply smelling a Tripel often sends excited tingles through my limbs - but this one, not so much. It has a familiar mulled pear or apple note, hints of clove or nutmeg, and a subtle sweet breadiness, something like a moist sponge cake. But it's not exactly what I was looking for... 

It's common practice for Belgian brewers to use 'candi sugar' in Abbey-style styles, like Tripels. What's essentially just caramelized beet sugar provides a highly fermentable food source for the yeast which helps boost alcoholic strength without leaving behind too much residual sweetness.

In this recipe, however, either too dark a variety was used and/or it didn't entirely ferment out. Both sweetness and booze are both prominent, the former not surprising given the colour but the latter a little unexpected given its alcohol content (8%) actually clocks in at the lower end of spectrum for this style.

Regardless, I'm not a professional brewer (or even a decent homebrewer for that matter), so I won't speculate on the possible technical or scientific explanations, rather just the facts: Floreffe Triple has a strong residual sweetness that's caramelly and fruit esters that stem more from ethanol than yeast. 

As result, this particular example provides fewer and less focused flavours of orchard and citrus fruits, and in their place a toffee-like maltiness out of place for the style. The peppery spice notes register as harsh due to flagrant alcohol and what should be a light, creamy, well rounded body is anything but. 

There are much better Belgian ales out there than Floreffe, but that doesn't mean Brasserie Lefèbvre's offerings aren't worth buying. Their Triple (or Tripel, depending on your linguistic allegiance) is middle-of-the-pack at best but shouldn't be entirely dismissed - it's a merely OK beer but can be found at relatively good value.Jun 16, 2016"
Floreffe Triple,4.0,4.25,4.0,4.25,"Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass. Consume before Oct 21st 2017.

Burnt orange body color, almost into a red amber territory but definitely on the brown side, and a bit murky. Lots of pinhead fine white streams of carbonation on the sides, matching to a frothy white bright head. Head retention is a mix of styrofoam and weak soapy appearances, but doesn't move at all with an easy three fingers, more if you are aggressive on the pour. Head just wont budge and keeps getting lapped up with each bubble coming forward, and cling cling cling ROCKY clumps abound while drinking.

This is a real interesting nose. Mineral and floral notes, with a real honey kick but with a much less subdued sense of sweetness. There's a touch of faint phenol clove character but also some rye like spicy quality as well. Very unexpected, gotta love the variety on these Belgian tripels, and this nose is quite a unique and memorable one.

Palate makes a big surprise. Caramel malts and a big crisp carbonation not unlike a Marzen. Hints of toffee and also banana esters but then some of that classic tripel candi sugar comes in a little bit. Playful carbonation but also a real nearly doppelbock German quality in flavor. Soft mix of sweet banana, and almost vanilla cream in the mix, with a good phenolic brown spiced finish.

This almost comes off as a Marzen large doppel belgian twist, which is a real fun and memorable beer. Not what I look for in this style particularly from a Belgian producer, but this is quite a neat made brew.Mar 27, 2016"
Floreffe Triple,4.25,3.75,3.75,3.5,"A: The beer is slightly hazy dark yellow in color and has a moderate amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a two finger high white head that took a long time to die down and consistently left a short head covering the surface and lots of lacy rings of bubbles down the sides of the glass.
S: Light to moderate aromas of Belgian yeast are present in the nose along with notes of fruity esters—bananas seem to stand out in particular.
T: The taste follows the smell, but isn't nearly as yeasty—there are more banana-like flavors and underlying notes of candi sugars. No alcohol is perceptible.
M: It feels medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This beer is quite drinkable for a tripel as it does a very good job at hiding any traces of alcohol from the taste. It's a nice choice if you like tripels that are a little fruitier and sweeter than the norm.

Floreffe Triple,4.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"30ml bottle, at 8% ABV, another part of the '1/2 Meter of Beer' mixed pack available here in Alberta.

This beer pours a slightly hazy, medium golden amber hue, with a teeming tower of puffy, rocky, and eventually Dairy Queen creamy opal head, which leaves a proper array of sudsy webbed lace all around the glass as it slowly ebbs away.

It smells of semi-sweet bready caramel malt, buttered white bread, a warm orchard fruitiness - peach, pear, and overripe apple - mixed table pepper, mildly spicy yeast, honeyed candi sugar, and a bristling, nose-twitching alcohol astringency. The taste is bready, somewhat biscuity pale malt, more booze-tinged apple, pear, and banana generic fruit bowl sweetness, sugary, floral field honey, active yeast bitterness, and a sidling, well-knowing, and sort of metallic edginess.

The bubbles are pretty well sublimated, barely a wisp of their initial splendour to be found at this mid point in the game, the body just on the lee side of a steady medium weight, and so-so smooth, the yeast and alcohol having their way right now. It finishes still on the sweet side, as things go, the caramel malt, additional sugars - alcohol and otherwise - kind of collaborating on the death knell (to me, at least) of this particular offering.

For the style, this does well enough, I suppose, providing a sweet, yeasty, and above all, boozy sort of experience. However, I am quite on the fence about such a plainly one-sided kind of deal - where be the hops, at least in the basest interest of balance? This comes off as an example of a beer that all the platitudes and pandering in the world wouldn't be able to deter those who think that it's actually all that good of an idea in the first place.Jun 12, 2014"

APPEARANCE: Translucent amber body with delicate bubbles streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Massive foamy white head comprising bubbles of varying size. Lasts a good five minutes.

T - Starts sweet and fairly fruity (apple, lemon, grapefruit, banana), with some caramel and bread. The finish has a nice hop bitterness and Belgian Candi sugary qualities to it.

M - Medium-bodied, moderately carbonated. It's got a nice creamy body but is a bit too boozy for a 7.5% beer, though, and becomes a little harder to swallow when it warms up.

O - This is a very decent tripel. Not the best, not the worst. Gives you an idea of what this beer style's got to offer and leaves you wanting a little more, perhaps.Mar 30, 2012"
Floreffe Triple,4.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,"Enjoyed a 0.5l bottle of this (€3.50) at Brasserie Lamborelle in Bastogne on 27SEP11.

This Tripel was a muted golden color, with a touch of haze present. Carbo was steady, with a foamy, lasting off-white head, and nice lacing. Some candyish aromas come forth, along with a bit of tropical fruit. Medium in body, it was a bit light and airy going down.

Flavor was not overly pronounced, with some light tropical fruit and a touch of bitterness mixed in. It was a little bit rindy at the finsih, which was somewhat dry. Solid but unspectacular. Prosit!!

Floreffe Triple,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,"Poured from 330mL bottle into a tulip.

Appearance: dark orange hue with a very slightly hazy body with suspended floaties. Head is two fingers of pillowy ivory foam. Darker than I normally expect for a tripel, but still quite nice.

Smell: deep, rich malt aroma. Smell is good but it lacks any of the fruity complexity I like so much in tripels.

Taste: rich malt and a fair bit of alcohol, despite its somewhat low ABV for a tripel. I like the malt character, but without any complexity this beer is almost bland, I'm sorry to say.

Mouthfeel: medium body with a good level of carbonation and concomitant creaminess. I like it.

Overall: this is a bit of an underwhelming tripel. I like it well enough, but it's just not complex enough to warrant seeking.Oct 01, 2011"

Appearance - a nice looking dark copper coloured beer. Small half finger of head stays for a short duration and plenty of visible carbonation.

Smell - some citrus namely grapefruit orange and a subtle underpinning of lime, with a surprisingly well developed caramel backing.

Taste - exactly like the nose also with the surprisingly good malt bill.

Mouthfeel- spot on with a light sessionable feel, brisk carbonation and just enough body to warrant this not be called hop water.

A: The body is orange with coppery hues. The head is minimal as it has almost no retention. There's some lacing. In general, I was expecting a bit more retention here.
S: The smell is very loose as you can only feel malts and a really minimal profile of citrus. Strong pine and citrus profiles is what to expect here.
T: The taste shows some improvement on the aroma by concealing some earthy tones like pine but it's way to fainted to provide a damn good taste profile.
M: Density is rather low. Carbonation is a bit harsh. And bitterness is relatively good.
O: I find this beer good for a beach purpose, for example. When you want to have a good option to take with you to sip and not overthink things. Sinceramente the taste profile is very simple and the density is low, this would be a good choice to soak up the sun.Nov 19, 2016"

Tastes of an aqueous beginning, mixed up with some cakey malts and dry, herbal, orange hops. Finishes watery and dull with a soft hop presence prevailing, which unfortunately is not able to safe this from being boring.

Baltika #9 Extra,3.75,3.75,4.0,3.5,"Poured from a pint bottle into a snifter glass
Appearance – The beer pours a deep brown color with a one finger head of off-white foam. The head has a decent level of retention, fading over time to leave a small amount of streaky and foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is very strong of a roasted malt mixed with a good deal of caramel sweetness and a little bit of a char aroma. Along with these smells comes some lighter notes of cocoa and a touch of vanilla.
Taste – The taste begins with a very malty roasty taste that has a little bit of a caramel and vanilla sweetness upfront. As the taste advances the roastiness stays very strong, while the sweet fades a bit. At the same time there is a woody and earthy flavor that begin to develop with a touch of a molasses joining in as well recovering a bit of the caramel and vanilla loss. At the very end a hint of alcohol and a decent hit of char hits the taste buds, leaving one with a nice dark and roasty taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is somewhat on the thinner side in terms of thickness and chewiness for a 7.0 % abv porter, with a carbonation level that is rather average. A tad more thickness and a bit less carbonation may have been slightly more appropriate for the style and the roasty/slightly boozy/drier toasted tastes of the brew, but overall rather decent.
Overall – A nice example of a very roasty and somewhat drier finishing porter. Not over the top of chocolate and caramel/molasses like may porters. Quite balanced and easy drinking.May 07, 2020"

Baltika #9 Extra,3.75,4.0,4.25,4.0,"I believe it is the first time I am having a Baltic Porter so I cannot compare with how they are supposed to taste like, but I really liked this one.

Look: Dark brown with a one inch mocca colored head

Aroma: chocolate, hint of dark fruits

Taste: Mild roasted malts, caramel, chocolate, dark fruits such as figs maybe raisins. Alcohol barely noticeable.

Feel: medium body, easy drinkingNov 08, 2017"
Baltika #9 Extra,4.0,3.75,4.0,4.5,"Dark brown with a ruby tinge when held to the light. Opaque. Topped with 3 fingers of beige, foamy head.

Smells of vanilla, chocolate, and cherries. Slightly fruity.

The taste is initially of chocolate and cherries, then turns into long lasting black liquorice, slightly sweet, toasted notes, but no abrasive charring. 

Medium, slightly bready body, moderate to low carbonation. Hidden ABV.

Got this in Chiang Mai, drinking it here Oct 4th, 2017. Really drinkable, smooth, good beer. Excellent rep for the style as far as drinkability.Oct 04, 2017"

Baltika #9 Extra,3.75,3.5,4.0,3.25,"Just a quick review of my first beer from Baltika (Балтика). Poured into a standard pint glass from a 1 pint, .9oz bottle.

Look: very dark brown, almost black. Very small head of off white foam. Quickly dissipating lace.
Smell: Molasses and caramel malt dominate the smell. Slight nuttiness / breadiness in the finish.
Taste: Dominant molasses again, even balance of caramel malt. Very similar to the non-alcoholic beverage Malta Goya, which is brewed with barley and hops like beer, but with a very recognizable caramel flavor profile balanced by molasses. Surprisingly fruity flavors linger, similar to dried apricots.
Feel: light body, medium carbonation, slightly sticky but smooth.

Overall a pretty good porter! I think my perception is slightly skewed by that Malta agota beverage that I drank so much as a kid. Not the best, but a very drinkable porter.Apr 02, 2017"
Baltika #9 Extra,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"S: molasses, chocolate, nut, toffee, low alcohol and moderate ester aromas that suggest stone fruit. No harsh or burnt, sour or tart aromas. 

L: pours dark brown with ruby highlights as streams of small bubbles rush to the surface. The 1/2"" foam cap is cream to light tan with moderate retention. 

T: palate starts nutty, malty sweet with dark dried fruit and soft alcohol. As it warms, figs come out more with light toffee notes and a hint of plum. Hop flavor and bitterness are medium low. There is nothing harsh or burnt. The balance is to the malt. 

F: The beer is smooth with a medium full to full body and mild soft alcohol warming. Carbonation is medium. 

O: This is a very drinkable beer with no harsh flavors.Mar 22, 2017"

The aroma of fruit and liqueur, roasted mixed with fried fruits, chocolates and peanut notes. Baltika 6 has an oily texture but not heavy, is incredibly smooth, velvety taste as above, but roasted is like fried fruits. Notes of chocolate, bitter like chocolates filled, background accents are a peanut. At the finish delicate burnt bitterness. Saturation low fit.Dec 14, 2016"

The Cannabis Club Sud,2.5,3.0,1.5,2.5,"Here’s an odd one: hemp beer. Never had that before. However I’ve often described beers with a “cannabis” hop aroma/flavour before, so I’ll be interested in seeing if that rings true with this brew. The brewery that makes this is Weißenoher Klosterbrauerei, and so far I’ve only reviewed one beer from them: Bonator - which is a Doppelbock I quite enjoyed (rated that one rather highly) so here’s hoping The Cannabis Club Sud is up to snuff as well. True story: I once tried smoking cannabis, but I didn’t inhale as I imagined that might one day wreck my hope of being a US president... turns out only US born citizens can become the president, so yeah if anyone has any pot: I’m game.

Poured from a 330ml bottle into a stein.

A: Almost clear, with a slight haze, yellow-tinged amber body with a 1 centimetre white cappuccino foam head on top. Not sure what to expect from a 5% hemp water beer but it looks a touch darker than most Adjunct Lagers so yeah... 5/10.

S: Aroma has a distinct hemp note (smells like a bag you might buy in a Bali marketplace) with a mixture of green herbal and dusty/earthy characters. There’s a dry grain character as well from the malt base. But otherwise this aroma is pretty stock standard Lager. I’m curious as to why they went in the Lager direction as a Pale Ale would have suited having hemp added to it more IMO. 6/10.

T: Bizarrely sweet upfront with corny/grain notes, pretty unpleasant, with a green vegetable mid palate, notes of hemp, black tea and earthy characters coming through, finishes with a slight herbal hit. The flavours are rather discordant and don’t add together at all. This isn’t the worst tasting beer I’ve encountered (Victoria Bitter still wins that dubious honour) but it’s not far off. The reason I believe is that the sweetness comes out of nowhere - when drier characters would work better with that green/herbal/tea taste that hemp adds. 3/10.

M: Mid to light bodied, very flat though, this could definitely use more carbonation... (or any carbonation). 5/10.

D: It was the best of beers, it was the worst of beers, it was the age of beerdom, it was the age of beerlishness, it was the epoch of wort, it was the epoch of brewing, it was the season of Ale, it was the season of Lager - in short, this beer is not a good beer in any Dickensian sense of the word, it is also no tragedy, though I won’t ever buy it again. What an odd, sad brew. 3/10.

Food match: Probably best not to entertain the thought of food with this...Sep 26, 2017"

The Cannabis Club Sud,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Woooah! Eureka! I found it! The worst beer in the world! Strange yellow/orange colour, like your morning urine when you have the flu and have been drinking too little. Smells and tastes like undefined nauseous industrial waste. (The hemp oil, I guess). Absolutely horrid, disgusting, abominable, appalling, detestable. Has anyone ever bought a SECOND bottle of this? Every school kid should be given a free bottle of this ""beer"" to keep them away from cannabis forever. Down the toilet it went (didn't want to contaminate the kitchen sink). I still shudder when I think of it.

Aroma is pretty good, light floral notes but predominantly citrus zest, lemon and orange.

Taste lacks the fullness if the aroma, but does carry that refreshing orange zest. Aftertaste is a little dry mouthed.

Feel is a touch watery to be honest, but at only 4.5% is expected.

Drinking this by the fire in December is maybe not the place, but for a Belgian Wit, this beer is pretty good. It would be a superb summer refresher on the grand palace square in Brussels.Dec 28, 2019"

Pours a nice dense creamy thick white head with great retention, lots of messy lacing, hazy golden straw color

Nose very grainy-sweet and very doughy wheat, bread dough, and a little tart, some citrus, more lemony, little zest, light phenol spices, so much raw bread dough and tartness it's almost more Berlinerweiss

Taste more cereal grainy malts, a bit sweet but not much, lots of citrus again, a little lemony and touch of young orange, some lemony tartness as well, a touch of phenol spices some creamy wheat with the dough, touch of bitterness, finishing drier, a touch more tart acidity and more bready dough 

Mouth is medium bodied, a bit creamy wheat and mild lactic acidity, medium carbonation

Overall this was an interesting beer, def not what I was expecting but I see how the tartness and creamy wheat comes into play in this style of witbier, which I def prefer the more Allagash or St Bernardus style than thisFeb 20, 2019"
Blanche De Bruxelles,4.0,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Look: Light golden hazy body; just under a finger of head on a medium pour into a standard tulip; poor head retention; average lacing. 
Smell: Lemongrass and yeast; the nose is relatively subdued. 
Taste: Lemongrass and maybe a bit of clove — tastes like a witbier. About average for the style.

Pours a hazy and cloudy bright straw yellow body, one finger thick white head, good retention and lots of lacing. Smell is a bit of mineral, typical wit spice profile, a bit of wheat and sweet bread. It's clean on the flavour side, a bit bland in some ways, not all that different though more full-throated in terms of flavour compared to Blue Moon. Medium-lighter bodied, good carbonation, goes well with the smoked sausage mussels that were ordered along with this.

Blanche De Bruxelles,5.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,"The bottom of the can says ""L5197 16/10/16 14:49""

Appearance: The body is a light golden straw color that is completely opaque. Shadows are only visible as haze. There is some sediment in the glass that is a bit large but it isn't chunky. The head is large and white with a fluffy cloud-like appearance.

Aroma: There is a very light citrus aroma to the beer with a touch of sweet coriander. 

Taste: It has a very nice fruity flavor to the beer which tastes like it comes more from the yeast than anything else. It has a bit of this passion fruit flavor and then there is a bit of some pear and a bit of what tastes like pineapple but not quite. I'm not getting any wheat here but the yeast character is very nice.

Mouthfeel: It is very light bodied and nicely effervescent. It Finishes a bit too dry and doesn't have a smooth texture on the palate. It finishes a tad rough but the overall drinking experience is decent.

Overall: I really liked the beer. I haven't had it in a bottle but in a can it seems to hold up pretty well for an import. I would drink it again and while it wouldn't be my top pick for a witbier I would still recommend it.Jul 26, 2016"

Looked like cloudy lemonade with a bit of a white head. Chunky yeast leavings floating around in there. Nice nose, oranges, some other citrus, maybe candied fruit (or fruit candy). Big blast of sweet fruitiness. Taste was not as impactful - mild, sweetish, fruity, gentle. Pleasant and very easy to drink quickly; you could almost forget it was a beer.

AROMA: banana front and center, with faint pepper and light orange citrus... suggests an easy, agreeable drink, with bubblegum and light barnyard yeastiness accompanying the experience... PALATE: light, soft-spoken sips that smoothly find their way to a bit more vibrancy at the throat's end... mouth-rinsing depth with an apologetic draw... thin and lacking an aftertaste of note--though one cannot expect much of this, given its style...drinkable, yes... TASTE: the orange peel moves among the wheat and banana to evoke creamsicle, with enough lemon grass and other citrus leaving an acidic finish...little other spice or nuance tov speak of, rendering this a straight-forward refresher... OVERALL: on an 80-degree day, I might have been less discerning, but in late December, this beer doesn't hold enough profile to be considered as an outstanding example of its genre... yet it doesn't challenge the palate or disparage its intentions either...Dec 31, 2015"
Tooheys Old,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,"This an outlier on the Australian beer scene; an old fashioned dark mild ale. It's a better beer than Coopers Dark Ale which is a relative newcomer. Toohey's Dark Ale has a fair amount of residual malt sweetness. It is lightly hopped. There are burnt caramel flavours, but not to excess and some pleasant fruity esters. (The Coopers equivalent overdoes the hops and is a trifle overcooked with the burnt toffee aromas, and imo is too dry to be a true mild ale. All of which points to a concession to their core hipster demographic and lovers of their IPA offering.)

The only major fault with Tooheys Old is it sometimes comes undercarbonated and struggles to keep a head. Accordingly, the mouthfeel is on occasions disappointing.Dec 12, 2020"

Tooheys Old,3.75,3.75,4.0,3.75,"Tooheys Old is a robustly flavoured Ale made with top fermentation Ale yeast. The beer is lightly hopped, and gets its darker colour from black malt.

Tooheys Old,3.75,3.75,4.0,3.75,"Format: a standard 375mL brown stubby with the traditional Tooheys macro label.

Appearance: pours a very dark brown tending towards plack with ruby-brown highlights against the light. A small tan head pops up before settling to a thick cap. Decent lacing.

Aroma: the aroma is roast coffee, some cocoa, a touch of caramel and earth. Decent.

Taste: once again the roasted malts up front with nuts, smoke and that earth on the palate. Really rather nice.

Aftertaste: bitterness comes from the smoke, nuts and malt on the finish. Not too dry either - easy to drink.

Mouth feel: I wouldn't consider the feel follows the English Dark Mild formula - it is lighter and with a much higher carbonation. It suits the Australian climate perfectly. I'm not sure it would be such a hit in colder climates however.

Overall: this is definitely one of my favourite 'every day' dark beers, along with Carlton Black. They are both an Australian take on the traditional English styles - similar characteristics, but with a lighter body and higher carbonation to make them easier to drink in a session, and more refreshing in the Australian heat. I really would consider them more an excellent version of a dark lager than an English Dark Mild. Decent price too at AU$45 a case of 24 x 375mL. One of my favourite pub beers is a Tooheys Old / Tooheys New black-and-tan. I will say I do prefer Old on tap rather than in the bottle, but good nonetheless.Dec 10, 2014"
Tooheys Old,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,"75ml bottle, 4.4% ABV, sold in pretty expensive six-packs up here in the Great White North. Zero suggestion on the label of style, beyond 'old', and 'ale', and I'm guessing that this is nowhere near an 'old ale'.

This beer pours a clear, very dark cola-highlighted roan brown hue, with two fingers of tightly puffy, and somewhat bubbly tan head, which leaves some random geological rockface lace around the glass as it genially recedes.

It smells of semi-sweet roasted caramel malt, bittersweet cocoa, earthy yeast, softly astringent cold coffee, oily packaged nuts, a bit of toasty smoke, and very subtle earthy, leafy hops. The taste is clammy bready caramel malt, a sort of soaked and put away wet, weakly smoked ash, underwhelming chocolate and coffee notes, and mildly bitter leafy, floral, and weedy hops.

The carbonation is pretty sedate, barely even noticeable at times, the body just on the lee side of medium weight, and plainly smooth, nothing else really manifesting here to mar the status quo. It finishes off-dry, the caramel malt, mild chocolate, wet bread, and earthy, leafy hops closing up shop.

Not a bad brew, but kind of thin, and somewhat underwhelming, even for this generally anemic style. There's enough flavour to make a go of it, if moderation and sessionability are your goals for the night, but for a singular experience, this just doesn't have the legs.Dec 05, 2013"

Tooheys Old,2.5,3.0,2.5,1.5,"Todays bruview is a classic Australian from a brewery that has in my past asserted itself as the least offensive of an offensive lot (Macro brewers over here in general): Tooheys. And 'Tooheys Old' is that reason. It's always been my go to beer at smaller pubs that have none of those ""fancy"" beers (i.e. micro-brews) that I know and love.

Poured from a 375ml ""overwhelming-sense-of-value"" bottle into a tulip pint.

A: Looks like a stout; a deep brown/ruby body is topped with a thin white lacing. Interesting to note: the carbonation air bubbles are bigger than normal, I suspect this will be noticed when I have a sip.

S: Burnt barley grains give this brew a toasty biscuit aroma. There is a slight smokey smell. Also detecting a wateriness underlying the whole brew. No hop aromas, however this is expected for the style.

T: Not a bad brew. It's similar to Cooper's Best Extra Stout, but not as boldly flavoured; bitter (though this is much less bitter than CBES), smokey with a toasted barley note throughout. It's a more accessible stout for people who aren't stout drinkers... I'm not one of those people, so I'm rating it according to my own stout fanaticism.

M: I will put this out there; this is a gassy beer. I can normally down an entire pint of beer without letting out a loud belch, I couldn't with a stubbie of this. Also that gassiness gives a sense of feeling bloated, which really detracts from the whole experience.

D: Let me reiterate: this is the best of the macro-brewers (and I'm not counting Cooper's as a macro-brewer) beers. By a long shot. I've never been a fan of Aussie lagers... they just suck. They suck even more in comparison to foreign lagers. Which I guess which is why I would go a stout from a macro over a macro lager. Is it better than Sheaf Stout? No, but I've never seen Sheaf on tap and as such I don't classify it as a ""macro"".

Food match: Something heavy to counter the dreaded stomach bloat mentioned above. I think a roast dinner would match well with this, preferably roast beef with a heavy gravy and a side of roast potatoes and carrots.Sep 04, 2011"
Tooheys Old,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,"Dark brown but does lighten noticably at the rim. Good nose for a megalarger; sweet toasty malt, good lift. Doesn’t quite translate into the palate, traces of the malt evident early but falls into a more mainstream palate with some fizz and some weak malts to finish.Aug 14, 2011"
Tooheys Old,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,"Pours black - off-white head recedes sadly for an on-tap pour.

No aromas as on-tap, Sad.

Taste is malts / sugar, some smoke/ashtray but in moderation.

Carbonation was a bit excessive, but didn't kill the beer

Overall an OK tap beer in the Sydney wasteland of RSLs etc.... if only you could ask for it 20 minutes up-front to allow to warm!!!!

Edit

Go-to winter beer these days.
I am now used to a wonderful roast sweet malt aroma, and easy drinkability.Jul 09, 2011"

Tooheys Old,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Reviewed from notes taken on a recent visit to Sydney.

Poured into a wine glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically. 

Appearance: As poured the beer is a nice rich mahogany color with a ¼"" light tan head that soon recedes to a thin film and a small ring around the glass. Sipping leaves patches and speckles of lacing, some of which cling and some of which slide back into the liquid.

Smell: There is a light aroma of chocolate and roasted malt but not a lot else but then its not supposed to show much in the way of hops..

Taste: The dark roasted malt flavor offers touches of chocolate and coffee and has some light bitterness and sweetness in it. Mild it is.

Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is on the light bodied side with moderate to low carbonation. The finish is medium to short and mostly on the sweet side.

Drinkability: I found this one reasonably drinkable and I'd be willing to have a second one but I'd not seek it out if there were alternatives. But on the other hand I'd certainly could have a second and would if I'd bought two of them.Nov 07, 2010"

D - This Ale will appeal to the masses and hopefully progress them to the ""Dark Side""

Tooheys Old,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,"(Served in a globe glass)
A- This beer has a glowing deep brown base to a black body that is crystal clear. There is a thin film of light tan head with tiny strands of bubbles gliding to the surface.
S- The light chocolate roasted malt flavor is nice but a bit one dimensional.
T- The soft dark roasted malt has a note of bitterness and a slight tartness to follow with a tootsie roll finish.
M- This beer has a light watery texture and no alcohol heat. D- This beer has some nice schwartzbier qualities but the flavors are really muted and not much depthNov 10, 2009"
Tooheys Old,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,"The beer pours a dark reddish brown. Not a great head but it is better on tap.

Nice aroma, the taste is of medium body malt and hops.Good mouth feel. Michael Jackson can taste cream and oloroso sherry!

I think the charm of this beer is its history, drinkability and sessionabilty-without ever boring the palate like most australian lagers. This top fermented ""old"" style predated Toohey's ""new"", and represents one of two surviving true ales in mainstream aussie brewing, the other being Coopers sparkling ale.

I like this beer better than some of the modern boutique beers becaiuse they try too hard with assertive flavours-this one is effortless, real, traditional and also won't stonker you with too much alcohol.A bit of a genuine find.Aug 29, 2009"
Tooheys Old,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,"Appearance - 3.0
Pours a modest beige head that quickly disappears over a dark brown body that has hues of red and gold when held to light.

Smell - 3.0
Slightly sweet, stale bready malt, no detectable hops. Improves with warming with faint dark chocolate and coffee aromas.

Taste - 3.0
Some of the bland grain and husk flavours that I usually associate with Tooheys beers are there, but in general, Old is a step above the rest of the brewery's products. Slightly toasty with a hint of caramel, coffee and vague fruitiness. Bitterness is low, just enough for balance and no real hop flavour.

Mouthfeel - 3.0
Moderate carbonation is somewhat coarse over the tongue, body is more akin to that of a pale lager; quite light.

Drinkability - 3.5
A very sessionable beer, but not for real beer enthusiasts.

OVERALL - 3.05
It's sad to know that one of the best macro brewed beers in Australia barely achieves a score of 3. Toohey's Old is not a great beer, but it is something I have turned to at pubs that give only macro offerings. Inoffensive and drinkable, but there are so many, much better micro brewed alternatives.Jul 27, 2009"
Tooheys Old,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured a brown colors. looks creamy with a nice head
second tooheys product that I try, and the taste is good. easy to drink as well. Another decent brew from Tooheys. I like the big size bottle as well. Mouth feel is creamy a bit, not too much, smells good. overall good beer.Jun 03, 2009"
Tooheys Old,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Poured from a brown 12oz twist off bottle into a pub glass. A freshness date of 10/29/09
The pour produces an inch or so of cola like snap crackle pop head. Receeding to a thin retention cap. The color is a darker brown with red hues smoldering when held up to light.

Aroma of smoked peat, chocolate roasty grains, just flat out malt bomb. Some mild sweetness at the knose.

Wow, the mouthfeel has a bit of a creamier full bodied feel to it, impressed with that. Mild carbonation throughout with a clean crisp finish.
The taste is smooth, well balanced and extra malty, with hints of bitter chocolate, plenty of cereal grain and a smokeyness from midway to finish. The grains border husky, but dont really cross the line, just flirt with it.

I'm really taken back at how good this is for the style, it follows it well and is a solid brew. The other Australia beers my buddy brought back for me were pretty terrible. This however is a solid english dark. Exceptionally sessionable at its current abv. Somthing I would definatly order at a pub.May 15, 2009"
Tooheys Old,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0,"Dark reddish brown on the pour with a thin, oily-looking off-white head which disappears right away. 

A nice smell of dark, caramely malt and (stale) coffee with a really faint rummy character from the cane sugar - though beer probably shouldn't really have that last smell, as such. Like I said, nice, but it's weak. I had to swirl it in the glass and stick my face in there until some of it accidentally went up my nose. 

Molasses, coffee... not much else. Bi-carb soda in the finish. This was my favourite beer as soon as I was old enough to drink, which was admittedly some time ago.... is it nostalgia or have they changed the recipe? It used to be nuttier and more bitter. Or did it?

On tap, this is fizzy mess, but out of the bottle carbonation is alright. It's probably not on the cards for Tooheys to make a proper dark mild (pretty sure this is a actually a lager), but a happy medium would be nice... this is close enough, I guess. 
Not real interesting, but very drinkable. If you live in NSW, someone's bound to leave some at your house eventually. Go for it.May 02, 2009"
Tooheys Old,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,"This pours black with some ruby highlights. Centimetre of beige head drops away. Some lacing.

Toasted malt aromas with notes of burnt coffee and bitter chocolate.

Palate similar to aroma with bitter chocolate dominating.

Light bodied. A little thin.

Tooheys Old,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,"Poured into a 500ml mug, nice fluffy 2 finger head...although looked like cola very much. Bubbles stuck to the side of the glass, & only a fraction darker than cola.
Aroma: Sweet charcoal, burnt, roasty malts, with a little hops..& very slight licorice.
Taste: sweet roasty malts...this is sweet with a little bitterness...nice balance...I love the wood-fired flavour. This is good!
Mouthfeel is good...not too heavy, but then again a little watery, although the carbonation seems alright for the style (would have liked a little more towards the bottom of the mug).
Drinkability is not a problem, I have tasted dark ales that tasted a little heavy with artificial syrupy mouthfeel...I reckon the watery feel works in this ale's favour...Oct 03, 2008"
Tooheys Old,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,"Appearance - Dark, 2 fingers of head which reduced quickly.

Smell - Sweet and coffee-like.

Taste - Also coffee-like. The roasted malt dominates the taste a little too much.

Mouthfeel - A bit watery, low carbonation.

Drinkability - The excessive roasted malt makes this harder going than it should be.

Overall - A good alternative to Tooheys usual low quality lagers.Apr 24, 2008"
Tooheys Old,4.5,3.0,3.5,4.5,"A solid, very flavourful beer. I got introduced to this brew at Bondi Icebergs in Sydney NSW. I was quite impressed. It poured into the glass with a lovely mahogany dark color and the head was thick for a beer on CO2. The nose had hints of coffee and dark chocolate which translated nicely to the taste where I found more dark chocolate notes. The flavour is very nicely balanced. Sweet enough for me while still a bit bitter on the finish to balance it off. A great session brew. Actually, my BA avatar is a photo of this beer at Bondi Icebergs. I highly recomend the pub and the beer. As you can see the view is quite nice. Cheers mates.Apr 15, 2008"
Monteith's Black,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,"One of the few beers I've actually asked for my money back. Extremely poor carbonation. Yes it produced a head but this disappeared almost immediately and what was left was flat and insipid.

I know from my home brewing days that such a result can really only occur if there are insufficient proteins and oils in the beer (from the grain and the hops respectively). Given that it doesn't call itself a porter or even a dark ale, one has to wonder whether this descriptive coyness is necessitated by the possibility that the colour is achieved not by the addition of a proper measure of patent malt, but by colourings. I can't discounted that this an adjunct beer heavily influenced by simple sugars rather than grain and malt, nor that the end result is produced with the assistance of artificial flavours and colourings. It really IS that dodgy. 

Amazingly, this sells at a premium price point in Australia (typically $1 a stubby above local corporate brews). Who knows why. Homesick Kiwis maybe, or young kids thinking it is a craft brew.Aug 01, 2021"
Monteith's Black,4.5,4.0,4.25,4.25,"A great black beer you can drink year round. Not at all heavy with a nice combination of coffee/caramel/chocolate. Heavily recommended. As a main stream beer it's up there with many craft beers.Oct 23, 2017"
Monteith's Black,4.5,3.75,4.0,3.75,"Had on tap at Ellis May in Franz Joseph in NZ. Wow...people are hard on this beer. I enjoyed it. Lot of these chain restaurants have some bad beer (Speiths....:( )....but this I liked. Not a huge chocolate fan, but the combination of this and the juiciness of it left me happy. Wouldn't seek it out but for now a good beer. On another note, some damn good beer here in New ZealandApr 16, 2017"
Monteith's Black,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Dark thin brown appearance with a sign I ant head and too much carbination. Mild fruity aroma that is a little lacking. Taste is very smooth fruity taste but nothing that is too memorable.Oct 23, 2016"
Monteith's Black,4.0,3.75,3.25,3.25,"It has an interesting aroma, and its colour was interesting. However, its head was disappointingly weak, with no creaminess to and the main body of the beer was perversely watery. I couldn't believe how flat the beer was.

Monteith's Black,4.0,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Bottle: standard 330mL brown bottle with a simple but stylish label. (3.5)


Appearance: pours a great dark brown tending towards black, with a solid one-finger tan head that hangs about for ages. Great lacing too. (4.0)


Aroma: roast coffee up front, with some dark cocoa and bread malts. (3.75)


Taste: pretty much follows the nose - some sweetness with plenty of that roast coffee and cocoa. Lovely. (3.75)


Aftertaste: the flavours linger nicely, but without too much malt fug or bitterness. A touch of sweetness comes through - possible star anise? (3.75)


Mouth feel: moderate in feel with light-to-moderate but solid carbonation. Goes down easy. (3.75)


Overall: a very nice dark beer from Monteith's. I headed into this one with a little trepidation, as Monteith's is a bit hit or miss. Well complex and easy drinking. Great for a price of AU$55 a case of 24 x 330mL also (2014).Aug 27, 2014"
Monteith's Black,4.25,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pint at the brewpub in Greymouth 11/3/14 from notes

A dark cola liquid with a dense finger of foam that's gone in a flash but even after it falls the thin film leaves continuous lace deep down the glass

S a little sweet with a hint of peat smoke, milk chocolate and coffee come out a little but it smells pretty tame but then again it was served ice cold

T mimics the smell without the peat but still a little smoky, simple brew for sure, decent but needs a little something

M lighter side of medium, soft carbonation, creams up after a few seconds, a little charred wood and chocolate linger

O OK stuff, pretty basic but drinkable, not going to be blown away but no reason not to try it ect..ect..ect...

the ice cold serving temp probably doesn't help its cause. just another brew that I won't remember down the road.Mar 19, 2014"
Monteith's Black,4.5,3.25,3.5,3.5,"On tap at the brewery in Greymouth, NZ

Excellent clarity in this very dark brown ale. The body is topped by a creamy tan head that is very durable and leaves the glass almost totally coated. 
Both flavor and aroma are about average for style, if a touch more hoppy than a European version. Dark and medium roasted malts lend a lingering malty aftertaste. No burnt notes.

T: Taste of roasted malt, some caramel sweetness, dark fruit, with a trace of chocolate and coffee. Nice bitterness and the finish is quite clean. 

F: Moderate body and smooth. Nie balance.

Monteith's Black,3.0,2.25,2.0,2.5,"Appearance: Brown-black body with a tall, but thin, tan coloured head. Leaves a small amount of lacing down the glass. 

Aroma: Black american-style coffee (not espresso), roast grains, and a little bit of 'dry' sweetness.

Taste: Quite bitter and burnt flavours at the front, with some smoother (but not smooth enough) caramelised malt following. Finishes with a slightly mettalic ash taste that is quite unpleasant. A bit flat and thin. I can tell that it definitely is not a stout!

Mouthfeel: Quite dry, with medium carbonation. Quite a light body, but too harsh and astringent to be enjoyable.

Overall: No thanks. I didn't enjoy this at all, but am not sure if it is the beer or just the style, as I haven't had another Schwarzbier before. I think I can understand what it is trying to achieve, so I will try to find a better example of the style.Feb 27, 2013"
Monteith's Black,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"0ml Bottle: best before the end of Oct 2012, whoops. Poured into a Westvleteren chalice on 7th Dec 2012, a bit late!

Looked impressive: lovely dark body with a deep tan head of foam (well for 60 seconds anyway).

Initial aroma leans towards a Stout maltiness smell and mild chocolate notes waft through the air: good for a Black Lager.

The taste is also Stoutish, but with the lager crispness reminding you this isn't at ale based beer. Those aforementioned chocolate notes can be found it the taste as well as in the nose along with slightly burnt caramel flavour.

A lot better than I thought it would be and could well be my highest scoring beer of this style so far.Dec 07, 2012"

O - Not a bad beer but lacks a little in complexity to really make you wanting more. A little disappointing in the finish.Jul 01, 2012"
Monteith's Black,3.0,4.0,3.5,2.5,"And just like that I'm off to Aotearoa... not literally of course (been there, done some of that), but taste-figuratively, and Monteith's is to me the James Squire's of NZ - not awesome, but they do a decent enough job to keep me buzzing with beer-warmth in those dark winter days of choosing from the local pub tap. Speaking of ""dark winter days"" dark beer is certainly the type of beer for that time of year and with winter thrust upon us antipodeans again I am once again reminded of the taste of a decent Stout. Rich and rewarding, like a treasure chest full of stolen pirate doubloons, AARRR!

Poured from a 330ml bottle into a nonic pirate... wait, pint.

A: Deep, deep ruby red body (like a Guinness), with a dusting of tan. Looks like a Stout, aye.

S: Toasted wheat grains upfront with a sweet honey/vanilla musk, and some liquorice characters as well... intriguing, not average Stout aromas, however I am reminded it is a Schwarzbier (German for ""darker than all those lagers and wheat beers we drink, jawohl!"").

T: Fairly flat and dry tasting. Bit of that honey and vanilla resonates and the undertone of classic Stout flavours (think chocolate, chicory and espresso coffee), but with a hint of pale ale; caramel malts and light floral hops. Not fantastic, but not bad either. Preferred it to the 4 Pines Stout I just tried.

M: Flat carbonation with a medium body. Found the carbonation too flat - needs a little bit more here.

D: Yeah it's not bad. Not bad but not great either. It's just a shoulder shrug beer - someone asks you if you like it and you shrug your shoulders in reply. I'm not convinced Monteith's, I need something more exciting. That being said it is Monteith's, the James Squire's of NZ, and I guess it's about as much excitement I will get from them. I'm moving on to American Stouts (if I can get my hands on some) now.

Food match: [Copy and paste from the 4 Pines Stout] rack of roasted meat (any dark meat), side of roasted vegetables and heavy gravy, or a nice warm stew. Dessert: dark chocolate. Follow with a glass of port.Jun 20, 2012"

T - Cola, coffee, roasted malt. Cola is more dominant but restrained by the roasted malt.

Aroma- Has a ton of maltiness and sweetness in the whole aroma and has a type of German malt aroma that isn't present in many of the ""Black"" ales we have in the states also. Finishes with a clean yeasty/lager aroma too. 

Appearance- Pours 3 fingers of off-white head that keep for a long while. Has a DEEP brown/black color body and leaves huge lacing down the whole glass.

Flavor- Good, clean malty flavor, slight roastiness, and a sweet finish. Has even hints of chocolate throughout the drink. 

Mouthfeel- Light-Medium Bodied, High Carbonation, Smooth, and leaves roastiness on the palate. 

Overall Impression- Since I'm not sure if I've had this style before, very easy drinking and nice! Roasty, flavorful German lager that ends up being one of my favorites of the month from an import. WIsh this was available in the states. Would like to enjoy another one.Aug 16, 2011"

Baltika #6 Porter,3.75,3.75,4.0,3.5,"Poured from a pint bottle into a snifter glass
Appearance – The beer pours a deep brown color with a one finger head of off-white foam. The head has a decent level of retention, fading over time to leave a small amount of streaky and foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is very strong of a roasted malt mixed with a good deal of caramel sweetness and a little bit of a char aroma. Along with these smells comes some lighter notes of cocoa and a touch of vanilla.
Taste – The taste begins with a very malty roasty taste that has a little bit of a caramel and vanilla sweetness upfront. As the taste advances the roastiness stays very strong, while the sweet fades a bit. At the same time there is a woody and earthy flavor that begin to develop with a touch of a molasses joining in as well recovering a bit of the caramel and vanilla loss. At the very end a hint of alcohol and a decent hit of char hits the taste buds, leaving one with a nice dark and roasty taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is somewhat on the thinner side in terms of thickness and chewiness for a 7.0 % abv porter, with a carbonation level that is rather average. A tad more thickness and a bit less carbonation may have been slightly more appropriate for the style and the roasty/slightly boozy/drier toasted tastes of the brew, but overall rather decent.
Overall – A nice example of a very roasty and somewhat drier finishing porter. Not over the top of chocolate and caramel/molasses like may porters. Quite balanced and easy drinking.May 07, 2020"

Baltika #6 Porter,4.5,3.5,4.25,4.0,"From 470 ml bottle into pint glass. Also had one straight from the bottle. L.

Subdued, but some malty, fruit sweetness and finishing dry. Tastes less than it looks. F. A touch of tingly carbonation but generally smooth. O. The impressive looking bottle and look in the glass out perform smell and taste. I will drink again, because such a great looking beer, but a little underwhelming.

Look: Dark brown with a one inch mocca colored head

The taste is initially of chocolate and cherries, then turns into long lasting black liquorice, slightly sweet, toasted notes, but no abrasive charring. 

Medium, slightly bready body, moderate to low carbonation. Hidden ABV.

Baltika #6 Porter,3.75,3.5,4.0,3.25,"Just a quick review of my first beer from Baltika (Балтика). Poured into a standard pint glass from a 1 pint, .9oz bottle.

Look: very dark brown, almost black. Very small head of off white foam. Quickly dissipating lace.
Smell: Molasses and caramel malt dominate the smell. Slight nuttiness / breadiness in the finish.
Taste: Dominant molasses again, even balance of caramel malt. Very similar to the non-alcoholic beverage Malta Goya, which is brewed with barley and hops like beer, but with a very recognizable caramel flavor profile balanced by molasses. Surprisingly fruity flavors linger, similar to dried apricots.
Feel: light body, medium carbonation, slightly sticky but smooth.

Overall a pretty good porter! I think my perception is slightly skewed by that Malta agota beverage that I drank so much as a kid. Not the best, but a very drinkable porter.Apr 02, 2017"

T: palate starts nutty, malty sweet with dark dried fruit and soft alcohol. As it warms, figs come out more with light toffee notes and a hint of plum. Hop flavor and bitterness are medium low. There is nothing harsh or burnt. The balance is to the malt. 

F: The beer is smooth with a medium full to full body and mild soft alcohol warming. Carbonation is medium.

Viru,2.25,2.0,2.25,2.0,"Can from the beer store - Pours a medium clear gold color with a 1 finger white cap that disappears quickly.

Clean, no off tastes, sharp edges-lacks conditioning acute LME dextrin tastes and light hop presence - instantly forgettable.Aug 17, 2017"
Viru,3.25,3.0,3.25,3.0,"00 mL can purchased at The Beer Store; dated Oct 28 2016 and served well chilled.

Pours a clear medium-golden colour, topped with roughly one finger of frothy white foam that fizzles off ahead of the five minute mark. A modest-sized collar is the only remnant - there's no cap, and not much in the way of lace, either. Visually, it's interchangeable with most other Euro lagers, and the same could well be said of its mundane aroma - there's just not much to speak of, other than cereal grain sweetness and some grassy, weedy hops. Perhaps a hint of apple skins?

Yep... it's a Euro lager. Doughy malts and barley grain are the most prominent flavours, with minor hints of apple juice tartness and corn sugar becoming apparent by mid-sip. The back end is mostly the same, save for a light brushing of grassy hops - just enough to provide some semblance of bitterness, tasked with the futile mission of countering the sweetness of the malt profile. Light in body, with moderate carbonation levels that briskly agitate the surfaces of the palate. Not as crisp as I prefer from this style, but the mouthfeel is otherwise fine. This is a tolerable, unmemorable pale lager, not unlike the other Baltic (and Polish) lagers I've tried in the past.

Final Grade: 3.22, a C+. Viru is drinkable as far as basic pale lagers go, but I really wouldn't call it an especially well-made beer - the term ""Baltic pilsner"" appears on the label, but that's a half-truth at best. I'd argue that it has more in common with standard Euro lager fare (Grolsch, Heineken, et al.) than it does with the typically higher-quality pilseners of German/Czech origin - which generally include a more robust hop presence than Viru can muster. Not something I intend to revisit - you could definitely do worse than this beer, but doing better is equally trivial - so tick it once if you wish, and then move on to greener pastures.Jul 17, 2017"

Smell: kind of a wet-grain aroma with a little sweetness and a little bit of cooked corn. That said, it doesn't smell disgusting or anything. Just a little mass-produced, maybe adjunct-y.

Taste: lightly sweet malt flavor with a bit of wet grain. Hops are at least discernible, though bitterness is low. Nothing great, but nothing terrible either.

Viru,2.75,2.75,2.5,3.0,"A 300ml bottle with a BB of July 2014. The bottle is an interesting octagonal cone shape. Acquired a while back from a supermarket. My gut feeling is that the bottle will turn out to be the best feature of this brew.

Poured into a straight pint glass. A clear pale-gold colour with good carbonation. Forms a small head of white foam that lasts for a minute or two before reducing to a patchy surface layer. Aroma of faint malt with hints of stewed leaves, overcooked veg and a twinge of DMS. Not particularly pleasant.

Tastes of ultra-light malt with a dry finish. Notes of cabbage/overdone veggies, stewed leaves, husks, a whisper of malt and faint corn. Well-attenuated, followed by a subtle bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth, tingly and dry, with spritzy carbonation and a thin, watery body. Slightly astringent, accompanied by an aftertaste of stewed veg/leaves and husky grain.

Bleh - a decidedly subpar lager. Looks pretty average, while the aroma and flavour are faint and beset with off-notes that detract from the experience. Lacklustre body. No great shakes; bland and unsatisfying. Do yourself a favour and give it a miss.May 12, 2014"

Appearance: Pale yellow color that doesn't seem to be completely filtered. No head. No lacing. Really just looking like piss water.

Smell: Stale corn... not even that fake corn syrupy corn aroma, just smells stale and a bit dirty. Dank. Not pleasant, and quite frankly off-putting. These sorts of beers don't tend to smell GOOD, but this one almost comes off as flat out offensive.

Taste/feel: Thin with incredibly prickly carbonation is the very first thing I notice. I mean... prickly carbonation like a pop/soda kind of thing. The flavor, well... what flavor? A bit of that stale corn. Subtle sweetness. Wet cardboard, for sure. Adjuncts all over the place in this one. There's really no aftertaste, bitterness, or sweetness whatsoever that I can tell. This is just an incredibly poor beer, and quite frankly I'm surprised at the high ratings for this brew considering its style. 

A novelty sort of thing is all this is. The bottle's neat, but the beer may honestly be worse than Bud Light in my opinion. Bud Light somehow has more flavor. This seriously might be the first time an adjunct lager sort of beer has actually let me down.

It poured a half finger of nearly white head. Lace tries diligently to cling to the side of the bottle. A veritable army of bubbles marches up the body on this guy during consumption, and great head retention.

The smell is weak. Beat-up bready malt and hand-me-down grassy hops.

This one is slightly sweet on the beginning. Tastes a little adjuncty. Grassy hops with a light spice end it on a slightly dry note.

The mouthfeel is light bodied. It slides over the tongue easily enough.Sep 05, 2013"
Viru,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5,".1 fl oz. bottle, with best before 27.12.13 printed on the cap. Found this bottle at a Binny's for something like $3.00. Premium beer from Estonia. Expectations are in the average range, considering the style and this beer's poor ratings on BeerAdvocate.

Poured into a Miller Lite pint glass.

A - Slightly aggressive pour on the finish conjures about two fingers of bone white sudsy head that fades away to a film quickly. Body is one of the clearest palest straw yellows I've ever seen.

S - Nose is comprised of dusty grainy malts, corn, hint of lemon, and wet cardboard.

T - Taste is of muted stale grains, malts, corn, hint of lemongrass, hint of cloves, metallic flavor, and wet cardboard.

M - Feel is coarse and dry, with a hint of bitterness & metal lingering.

Overall, this was a novelty beer that I mainly only bought because of the cool bottle. While it was cool to have the opportunity to try a ""premium"" Estonian beer, it would be cooler still if there were any redeeming qualities to the beer. Pretty inoffensive, but there really isn't any reason to seek this out more than once.

Viru,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,"300ml Bottle (The Cave, Glasgow):
Clear, light yellow, straw colour with not much in the way of a head. There is some fine, white lacing on top with a sort of bubbly look to it.

Very little in the way of an aroma, there is some dry, grassy hops and some malts with a touch of sweetness. Pretty basic and slight bit of citrus.

Sweet malts and dry, grassy hops taste that is very average and bland. There is a touch of citrus with some corn too.

Light bodied, slightly grainy and very dry with medium carbonation. Quite a thin and almost watery feel with touch of bitterness towards the end but not a lot.

Cheap tasting pale lager that is exactly what I had expected going in. The beer is inoffensive and fairly easy to drink although there is touches of grain and some skunk that are slightly off-putting.Jun 03, 2013"
Viru,2.75,2.25,2.5,2.0,"I've had some great beers from Eastern Europe over the years (Obolon and Zywiec being the best for me), so I thought I'd give this a go. It pours a pale yellow colour with barely any head to note. Smells like nothing - very faint malts maybe. Taste is really malty with just a faint bit of hoppy aftertaste. The feel is very uninspiring - it's like Coors Light with maybe a little more malt and hops. It tastes like it's got some adjuncts in it, which whether it does or not, is generally a bad thing. Overall it's a very cool bottle but a very boring beer.

Light hops and sugar in the nose, not much of any real interest. Sweet, unusual identified flavour to finish. Moderate mouth feel, a hint of grassy hops and some bitterness to finish.

Unremarkable, but not offensive.

Amarcord Gradisca,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,"Bottle purchased at Huckleberry’s in Spokane for $2.99. This was purchased in honor of my parents, who had just visited Italy for the first time. There’s no obvious freshness date on the label or the bottle itself. The label on my bottle appears a little different. I suspect the one shown here is the Italian label, whereas mine is for the American market.

Poured a cloudy, light straw color with a sudsy, bone-white head. Said head dropped fairly quickly, leaving sparce, spotty lace on the sides of my glass.

A slightly earthy grain scent, with some soft floral hops and a hint of skunk aroma greeted the nose. Smells like many a Euro Lager.

The flavor was of equally unobtrusive malts and hops. Pepe le Peu may have made a fleeting appearance in the aroma, but is mercifully not present in the flavor. 

Fairly light bodied, with a clean finish.

This is not a bad beer, but it’s not terribly interesting. It’s an average example of it’s style, no more and no less. While there’s essentially nothing wrong with it, there are beers out there that are more interesting and which cost less. I doubt I’ll need to try this again, but I might drink it if I were in Italy and wanted a beer.Oct 04, 2012"
Amarcord Gradisca,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,".2% ABV. Pours a pale light gold, with active carbonation and nothing in the way of lacing. 

Aroma is mostly crisp malts, with some hop component but not a lot distinguishing. 

Flavour is decent. Typical flavours of malt and slight hop bite, touch of citrus. With probably more flavour intensity and depth than your average euro lager. Shows a better complexity than many is this style. Finish is malty but quite full.

Mouthfeel is light, mostly carbonation. With maltiness only coming later.

Not really exciting, but nothing really offensive and relatively drinkable. In that regard its solid, but otherwise uninteresting.Aug 10, 2012"
Amarcord Gradisca,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. This bottle is named ""Special Lager"" and is 5.2 ABV, but the illustration is the same, so I suspect this is the ""Gradisca"" marketed to the U.S. Pours a pale slightly golden straw. Thin head crackles and disappears quickly leaving a few lost bubbles around the glass. Kind of sad, really. It looks like a glass of filtered apple juice. Aroma of faint bready malt with an odd boiled vegetable component. Flavor is better with light bready malt and neutral hops and a little bit of a hops kick on the finish. Somewhat redeemed by a pleasant lingering malt and light hop aftertaste. Light bodied and low carbonation. A step up from an adjunct lager, but not something I will seek out again.May 27, 2012"
Amarcord Gradisca,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,"A 330ml bottle with a BB of Oct 2011, so it's a few months out of date. Picked up from Beeritz in Knaresborough a little while back - I really should pay more attention to bottle dates. ABV is stated as 5.2%. The label mentions that this ale is bottle conditioned.

Poured into a Sam Smith's pint glass. A hazy pale-golden colour with medium carbonation. Forms a small head of white foam that lasts for a minute or so before dissipating. A faint aroma of light malt with a hint of earthy yeast and stewed hops. A mild whiff of sulphur/burnt matches in the background. Not much going on.

Tastes of light malt with a subtle, dry finish. Mild notes of dry yeast and a faint fruitiness. No real bitterness to speak of. Mouthfeel is light, crisp and tingly. Slightly dry. A weak yeasty aftertaste.

OK - a run-of-the-mill blonde ale. Pretty characterless. It's similar to a lager, but with a somewhat fruitier yeast presence. Well made, but it doesn't have anything to hold your attention. Don't go rushing to seek it out.Feb 13, 2012"

Poured into 10oz glass. Poured a cloudy yellow, similar to a wheat beer, with just a thin cap of white head that had low retention and no lacing.

The aroma was mostly clean grains, with just a trace of hops. There was just a hint of skunkiness. On the tongue, the beer was mostly benign, with the foremost feature being the nice grains. The hops were gentle in the background. There was no skunk in the taste.

The body was typical, thin and with a clean finish. Drinkability was decent, I could have a couple of these on a warm afternoon. Overall, a decent, if not special beer. Give it a shot if you see it.Mar 04, 2011"

Monteith's Golden Lager,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.5,"On tap at the brewery in Greymouth, NZ

Excellent clarity in this golden-amber ale. The aroma is quite light, perhaps even for style. The flavor is initially just as expected for a golden lager, but this beer has an appealing, and surprisingly malty finish. Well-crafted and balanced, as well as very fresh (of course). 

Feel: Light body with medium-high, very crisp carbonation. Clean, dry finish.

Monteith's Golden Lager,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,"0ml Bottle BB 10 Oct 2012: poured @ home into a Westvletren chalice on 07 Dec 2012, some two months after its best before date.

Looks OK: good deep golden body with a white covering that tries to hang around, but as in most beers of this style it fades to a wispy swirl and collar as you attack the beer.

Grainy nose more than hop or straight malt: taste is leaning towards malts, biscuity and semi-sweet. Crisp body and nice hop finish: easy drinking lager and with enough flavour to interest me. certainly one of the highest scoring lagers I've had since joining this site.Dec 07, 2012"
Monteith's Golden Lager,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,"A 330ml bottle with a BB of Oct 2012. Bought the other day for a song - offie was selling them cheap due to short date. Label mentions a cashew nut smoothness; that's just nutty.

Poured into a straight pint glass. A clear, rich golden-amber colour with good carbonation. Forms a large head of frothy white foam that lasts for a few minutes before subsiding to a thin surface layer. Aroma of sweet malt with a slight fruitiness that reminds me of ale yeast (?). Faint hints of stewed hops and some mild cardboard/solvent-like notes in the background. Not brilliant.

Tastes of light malt with a mild finish. Slightly sweet with a hint of grain. Notes of faint stewed hops, overdone veg and cardboard. A mild harshness in the background, followed by a weak bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth and tingly, with decent carbonation but an insubstantial body. Aftertaste of sweetish malt and vague hints of stewed veg.

Meh - none too good. The sweetness is particularly off-putting; a good lager is crisp and dry. Would benefit from some decent bittering hops, and the off-notes don't add anything either. Not very enjoyable and I can't recommend it. Spend your money elsewhere.Oct 22, 2012"

Is it legal to drink a Kiwi beer in Aussieland""....she said ""it must be....we sell it!"" Then I says...well set me up! She said ""what""? Then I said, could I have a Monteiths! Anyway I digress. Monteith's is a tasty Golden lager that has a light but decent body...good for hot days on the beach. The color was pure golden with white head that left good lacing.

Monteith's Golden Lager,1.5,2.0,1.5,3.0,"Had in a bottle at Auckland Airport. Unfortunately, I fear my ordering of the beers I tried here meant that the quality went downhill. Oh well.

Pours a bright but gaudy golden colour, living up to its name at least. Innitially, some large bubbled soda-like fizz froths up, but it settles to a minimal patchy film on the top of the glass. Lots of carbonation. Looks like every really bad beer I've had before.

Nose is light and grainy, with a fair whack of husk and a light honey-like sweetness. Very faint all up though. Not a lot to it at all. 

Taste is very light, with a very husky grain character throughout that leads to nothing on the back. The body just falls out at the end, leaving a faint and rather unpleasant yeast character. Feel is extremely thin, but bubbling with soft carbonation.

What a terrible way to end my beer adventures in transit. This is on a par with all the really terrible adjunct lagers out there in the wide world.

Drinkability-I am not keen on this lager, there's better for the price.Dec 01, 2009"
Monteith's Golden Lager,3.5,3.0,1.5,2.0,"Pours a golden colour with furious carbonation on first pour that translates into a good thick head of honeycombed bubble formation. None of that carbonation sticks around, although lacing certainly does albeit sparsely.

Nose is very sweet, with a molasses syrupy character to it, hints of some medicinal phenols and a touch of vanilla. Hops are subdued, but there, slightly phenolic without any real punch to them. Truth is it doesn't smell refreshing, but it's not too bad.

Taste is a bit of a disaster; I think a yeast bomb just went off in here. Hints of banana and honey on the front, and a bit of a dessicated coconut flavour as well. That's all good, but it's soon overwhelmed by a tidal wave of nutty, cloying bread yeast character, which not only strangles the palate but does the same to the finish, which simply disappears under the force of this unwelcome, unpleasant tsunami of flavour. Maybe a slight linger of phenolic bitterness, but certainly no noticeable back palate.

Feel is a bit sticky as well, could be full but there's no texture, it just crawls like a slug through your mouth.

Not a great effort here, flavour is unbalanced and there's no real likability, or drinkability. A bit of a struggle to get down actually.Sep 02, 2009"
Monteith's Golden Lager,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,"Drank from my Unibroue Tulip.

A - Nice golden colours, head comes up two fingers, but bubbles aren't uniform, a patchy head that dies away quickly, thin lacing around the glass.

S - Minimal hop aroma present, the malts aren't very pronounced either. I am getting an ""adjuncty"" smell that seems to be the strongest aroma present.

T - Sweet malts are present at first, these don't last long, then an adjunct flavour shines through and becomes the main flavour lingering on. A little cloying, the malt character isn't much. Hops/bitterness is barely present.

M - Sticky, leaving an adjunct taste on the gums and the roof of the mouth.

D - This beer seems to be in between a Munich Helles and a Euro Pale Lager. I think this beer would benefit with a more pronounced noble hop aroma and finish, this may overcome the ongoing off/sweet flavours that persist in the finish.Jul 13, 2009"

Monteith's Golden Lager,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,"0mL bottle. 
Expiry on bottle: September 2008
Served in a Monteith's 290mL glass.

I have tried Monteith's Pilsner before, and although I enjoyed it, I wasn't blown away by it and haven't bothered to buy it again. It was really a pretty standard pilsner that you could buy anywhere.

This brewer has a pretty high reputation, at least according to the Kiwis that I know. With that in mind, I persevered, determined to find a good beer.

Monteith's Golden is labelled as being a Munich style beer, a malty lager with a smooth, mellow hop flavour.

Appearance - A pretty standard lager colour, slightly darker than a pilsner. It had a lovely, creamy white head and slight carbonation once settled. Very little fizz.

Smell - Virutally none when it was first poured, the notes were very, very subtle. However, as the beer warmed up, the smell exploded from the glass, a lovely hit of malt, caramel and honey.

Taste - Initially I only found a slight malt taste, nothing fancy, just nicely balanced. Once again though, a bit of warmth and a gentle cashew taste followed by a slight hop bitterness in the aftertaste.

Mouthfeel - Chewy and soft.

Drinkability - If there was an open bar and I got to have Monteith's Golden Lager I'd be as happy as a pig in mud. This is an exceptionally drinkable beer. Perfectly suited to a warm day, this would make wonderful summer BBQ drinking. 

All in all, I don't think a C- is a fair rating at all, but to each his or her own taste.

My advice is let this one warm up a bit and you'll come to see why Monteith's are one of the best NZ brewers around.May 09, 2008"

Monteith's Golden Lager,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,"as with the original ale, a disappointment. monteiths is a subsiduary of DB, the second biggest brewery in new zealand. with this i feel they have tried to copy the flagship beer of the biggest brewery, lion nathan, that being steinlager. i would have expected monteiths to make a dramatic improvement on that, but alas, its only minimal.

its got a deeper golden color than most lagers, which i like to see. it suggests that its got a bit of power to it. the head is better than most lagers youll get from this region, a nice clean white foam that sticks around longer than most. but except for the stock standard crisp clean feel ive come to expect from kiwi beers, the only thing that makes this any better than most other boring australasian lagers was that theres a bit more maltiness to this one, hence the difference in color. but the aroma and finish aint much different to anything else you can get off the shelf here. 

this brewery have proved they are capable of much much more. i feel like theyve sold out a little, in the sense that they seem afraid to be too bold in the fear that lager drinkers around here just dont want to be challenged too much. in many regards they are right, but geez, they are a micro, and micros just arent supposed to subscribe to this view. this lager should be a cut above anything else down under, and it isnt. and steinlager is cheaper too. that pretty much sums it up for this beer.Oct 15, 2003"

Longboard Island Lager,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Straw out of the bottle into a wine glass. Moderate slow rising carbonation with a frothy white head. Crystal clear clarity. A touch of hop spice on the nose and ever so slight malt sweetness, akin to corn but more balanced. Minor floral notes, none specific. It is sweeter on the palate with a fantastic surprise of pineapple halfway through. Not pineapple juice but the actual fruit, well balanced with the delicate hop spice. I could see this pairing with barbecue as well as kale. It is hop forward, then fruit, then malt and nearly no alcohol taste. The feel is fuller than anticipated from 4.6 abv and appreciated. Smooth, slick and just a tad chewy. Carbonation feel is light. 

I do enjoy this as a better-than-macro lager if I steer from the German styles. The fruit hints are great and harder to achieve in lager, being very gentle here. Surely a summer sipper with modest class.Aug 04, 2021"

J then took a longer pull off it and it just went down so crisp & refreshing, I thought I had found the perfect lager beer! I had to join Beer Advocate to share my opinion on this crisp, quenching, Summery lager that kinda reminded me of the way I felt when I first tried Lone Star last Summer. 
I love how other reviewers talk about the “straw color” or “nice lacing”, but I’m the kinda guy who likes to drink bottled lagers from the bottle! I may drink stouts or ales in a glass, but it’s already getting hot in Georgia and I’m not here to look at the “pale head” or “lacing”! 
This is a damn good lager and I was glad it wasn’t too hoppy, like other ‘Laguna’-types I’ve tried.

Longboard Island Lager,4.0,4.25,4.25,3.75,"If you're looking for a hoppy, complex beer, then why are you drinking this? Seriously. In the world of clean, crisp, refreshing lagers, this brew stands out. Malt and hops are well balanced. One of my favorite session beers.Feb 27, 2021"
Longboard Island Lager,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,"Review: 355ml bottle of Longboard Island lager: 4.6% vol.

Available all year round this quintessential beach beer comes in cans and bottles, and on draft in Hawaii.

Cool logo on the bottle, of surfers on low tide, the problem with this is that it doesn’t look like a beer at all, more like something that advertises a fizzy pop. Bottle top is cool though as it has a pic of a lizard, the emblem of the company. 

On pour I get a standard looking lager, clear golden colour with a nice frothy white head, which diminishes fast enough. Typical lager look. 

The smell is very light, of grains and sweet malt, it is ok but very faint and weak……..

Nice crispy mouthfuls initially on the taste, a good start and a refreshing intro to this beer. Tastes like a regular lager and does the business for sure, smooth and easy to drink. 

But was a little disappointed as the price was a bit high compared to the many decent supermarket discount beers that can taste about the same or even better…….

Hops are on the very low level and any flavours are barely noticeable in the taste, the malts do make an appearance as you would expect, and it is a clean beer but is far too thin, a bit tasteless to be honest. I can’t imagine it would even taste any better if I was on a beach in Hawaii as the sun shines down on me head. 

A simple light lager, ok to drink but nothing extraordinary in an otherwise very crowded market…….something my mother would like to sip at I think! Not terrible just disappointing…….Dec 21, 2020"
Longboard Island Lager,2.25,2.5,3.5,3.5,"A pour from a brown 12 oz. bottle into a clear Imperial pint glass provides a look at a very ordinary beer. It's the close to translucent light amber found in most mass produced American lagers. No extra points for head, nor glass lace. There's a slight malt/hop aroma, but one to seek out, not readily available. This beer rebounds, however slightly, with the taste. There's a noticeable improvement on mass produced lagers here. Yes, it is on the sweet side, but the root of the sweetness is the malt, not the corn added to the wort. It's also slightly hoppier than those and actually is a refreshing version of a style not held in high regard.Dec 12, 2020"
Longboard Island Lager,3.5,3.0,3.25,3.5,"Slightly hazed, bright gold appearance with a small white head and a fair amount of lacing. Subdued, sweet malt aroma. Bready, malty taste with a sweet, fruity edge. Light-to-medium bodied, well carbonated mouthfeel. Finish dries out a bit but does not linger very long. Nice, easy drinking, session beer.Dec 11, 2020"
Longboard Island Lager,4.0,3.75,3.5,3.5,"Drinking this at Hurricanes Restaurant.
Poured from a tap into a pint glass.
Appears golden yellow with a nice foamy head that lasted and no visible lacing.
Smells lightly bready, malty and sweet.
Taste follows the nose, could be maltier the honey sweet aspect is predominant.
Mouth feel is light for the style.
Overall, I drank two of these with my dinner, so I would say pretty crushable for the style and I might order again.Nov 15, 2020"
Longboard Island Lager,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Look: Nearly clear pale yellow with a fizzy head that blooms up and immediately begins to settle leaving little lacing behind
Aroma: Light bready malt notes, some floral hops, cereal grains, and some honey
Taste: Barley malt and floral hops start off on the sip and linger some before being joined by a honey-like note of sweetness. Grains show up and lead to a light and crisp finish
Mouthfeel: Fairly full bodied but light feeling, medium-high carbonation, and a fairly crisp finish
Overall: Drinkable and good but far from outstanding. Nothing off-putting or flawed, just not huge in the flavor department and could use a little more crispness overall and drier finish to really pop in my opinion. Solid enough for a no-nonsense, easy-drinking American lager that I could easily handle a few of in a sessionOct 14, 2020"

Longboard Island Lager,3.25,3.75,2.75,3.5,"From a 12oz bottle dated 4/7/20 into a pint glass.

Pours a translucent pale yellow with about one finger of white head. Poor retention, average lacing.

Smells of grain, mainly corn and maybe just a bit of fresh baked bread.

Taste is pretty weak. Really doesn't taste like much at all. Maybe a touch of grain and a hint of skunkiness.

Mouthfeel...Well it's thin and fairly smooth which isn't surprising given the taste. Bit of skunky aftertaste.

Overall...This is my first experience with a Kona beer and it's not a great one. Glad this beer was a gift and that I didn't spend my own money on it.Sep 13, 2020"

Longboard Island Lager,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"2oz can with a date

Looks great, clear with a nice cap that sticks around. Smells like grain and hop; solid scent. Tastes like a 'double lawnmower beer' - easy to drink but with extra malt and hops, crushable and tasty.

Longboard Island Lager,3.75,3.25,3.5,3.5,"Look - poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Straw yellow in color, clear, and big frothy head that largely dissipates, leaving behind a one finger lacing.
Smell - light biscuits, a slight whiff of white pepper, but not much else. no skunkiness like some adjuncts, but nothing too fragrant either.
Taste - light in taste. Some malts balanced by a tiny bit of hops initially, which goes away quickly. finish is very clean.
Feel - light bodied, high carbonation, and low ABV (though normal for the style) at 4.6%.
Overall - this is a standard american lager, through and through. No funky smells/flavors like adjuncts, but really not much to write home about either. It gets the job done.Jun 13, 2020"

Efes Extra,3.75,3.25,3.0,4.0,"Efes Extra is a strong beer. 

Appearance  Has nice medium yellow colour. Low bubbles. 

Smell  You will notice alcohol and bitter sharp smell.

Taste  Has strong, solid, sharp taste.

Mouthfeel  First you will notice intense alcohol taste after bitter like taste. after one couple beer you will only notice sour taste. Because sugar overtake alcohol taste.

Efes Extra,2.0,2.0,1.25,1.25,"0ml Can in Ataturk airport, Istanbul:
Clear yellow straw with a small, bubbly head that is bone white and slowly turns patchy.

Very sweet sugar, lots of alcohol and grain plus a hint of butterscotch that I wasn't expecting. There is some honey and faint lemon as well. Bad but not disgusting.

This one tastes truly awful and is very hard to drink. The taste is sweet with tonnes of alcohol, a lot more than the 7.5% abv. on the can suggests. There is a lot of grain, a slightly skunky taste and some faint lemon. There is a hint of hops and a strong, syrupy sugar taste that results in nothing more than drain pour.

Very sweet and thin with a lot of sugar that makes the drink seem more like a watered down syrup than a beer. Cheap tasting and over carbonated resulting in a gassy body that was making me feel sick after only a few sips.

I'm not sure what I was thinking buying this and thankfully it counts as a new style that I have tried because it had nothing else going for it. Granted it is strong and cheap but why this one was on sale in an airport is beyond me, and since it was an airport it wasn't all that cheap. Disgusting from start to finish with too much sugar, alcohol and grain throughout and on top of that I was drinking it from a plastic cup on an airport floor so that didn't exactly help it any. That being said, nothing was saving this one.Aug 06, 2013"

Surely it is a beer to forgetMay 19, 2012"
Efes Extra,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,"Another gift from Uncle Cherry (Kirsch)'s trip to Turkey for The CANQuest (TM)! It reminds me of a birthday card someone once gave me that read: ""People who say that I am hard to shop for must not know where to buy beer."" Ha! He reported that it was somewhat tough to find a place to find alcohol of any stripe, but he happened upon a store that at least sold beer. One last one to go.

The Crack & Glug produced barely two fingers of fluffy bone-white head with moderate retention. Color was a very pretty sunshine yellow on this sunny Thanksgiving afternoon. Nose was quite malty sweet, but seemingly free of adjuncts like corn. Xtra is not extra, at least not with adjuncts but with a nice pop to its ABV. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a pleasant enough lager sweetness and only about half the heat that I kind of expected to be hit with. Finish was fairly dry, again not surprising given its relatively high ABV, simply suggesting that the fermentable sugars were all, as the Amish might say.Nov 24, 2011"
Efes Extra,3.0,2.0,1.5,1.5,"I had a can of this which I shared with my neighbors as part of a beer tasting. The color was yellow with decent carbonation. The carbonation yielded a white head that did not lace. There really wasn't much to smell outside of teh alcohol....some thought they could smell faint plumb. The taste was just alcohol and grain to me....I did not like this beer. The mouthfeel was yuck and I will not drink this beer again. However, when in Turkey...one should at least try it.Jul 24, 2011"
Efes Extra,3.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,"Copper with a golden hued, thick white head, leaves small lace clumpings.

Malty sweetness, slight roast malts, grain, floral and spicy hops, alcohol smell.

Strong alcohol taste, malted grains, citrus hops, but overall alcohol in flavor.

Medium carbonation, mild to smooth, but again the alcohol is the most noticeable.

One bottle was enough, too much alcohol and not enough real flavor.Jan 31, 2011"
Efes Extra,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,"My 7.5% ABV, 50cl can had no 'E' in its 'Xtra'. It did however have an alcoholic blast from start to finish.

It poured a solid looking deep golden colour, the head had gone within 10 seconds and 'The Headache waiting To Happen' just sat there staring back at me in my hotel room (Ovacik, Turkey).

This beer had no substance or style, just an alcoholic front, back and sides.

Could have been any of those terrible extra strong lagers dotted about Europe, all of which should be avoided.Jul 23, 2010"
Efes Extra,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,"This is the strongests beer that I could find in Turkey. Efes beers are pretty much the only ones you can get in Turkey. Beer culture is o0bviously not a big component in this country, but this beer in particular makes Miller light seem drinkable. Quite simply even for its style profile, its boring, bland, under-carbonated, and doesn't feel right.Mar 28, 2010"
Efes Extra,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,"For a high ABV-beer from a country that doesn't do beer well, I'm pretty impressed. It's pale gold with a very small head and smells like toffee malts and some grain with a bit of alcohol--but there's nothing unpleasant about it, it's above average for sure.

The mouthfeel is very light and refreshing, although there is an unpleasant burn at the end, and the taste is nice, I suppose--the alcohol is there, but so are the hops, and the malt is predominant, nice and sweet with some nuttiness in the finish. 

I'm used to hops and alcohol from the styles I drink but this is a nice malt-and-alcohol concoction--maybe the first Euro Strong Lager I've ever had? And honestly it makes me want to drink more. It beats the hell out of the rest of the Efes line.Jul 23, 2009"

D: Not too bad really. One of the best Efes offerings.Jul 21, 2009"
Efes Extra,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,"This is ok but not great. It's better than a number of strong lagers or malt liquors I've had, but not nearly as good as others. It's pleasant enough and easy to drink but a bit bland and rough in the feel.

Pale orange, it has a medium white head steadily shrinking to a tiny ring. 

The aroma is fermented grape juice and grain, with hint of fruit candy and a vague hint of orange juice. 

The taste is a bit alcoholic, but not overly so, with only a hint of roughness and with a definite warming quality. It tastes mostly of fermented white grape juice with white bread, a hint of fruit candy, and a light grain quality with a vague hint of grapfruit and orange juice. It has a slightly candy-like sweetness up front, followed by a vague bitterness and spicey bite to balance out in the end. It's mostly rather bland and a bit thin in the feel.Mar 02, 2009"
Efes Extra,3.0,2.5,3.0,4.5,"From an old bottle brought back from overseas. Sharing it with friends at Bodega in La Crosse. Ok head and lace. Very slight hazy amber. Likewise mild nose. The flavor is malty sweet without much distinction. But, where the beer really shines is in the body - Luscious!! Silky, mouthfilling, softy, very satisfying. maybe even too much. a bit warming from alcohol. decent finish.Apr 07, 2007"
Efes Extra,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,"Appearance: Pours a clear slightly orangish golden color with a small ¼ head of fluffy white foam. The head was active for about 20-30 seconds until it fell to a small ring around the top of the beer where it meets the glass. 

Aroma: I got a dominant grainy aroma along with a corny presence that may actually be corn or a flaw. Well see. Some floral hops are noticeable, but this beer is pretty subtle for an extra. As the beer sits some more, the graininess gets more aggressive.

Taste: The flavor is still grainy as the aroma suggested, but the beer is much heavier bodied than I expected. There is a syrupy sweetness under the brush that adds to the overall mouthfeel. There is still a strong vegetal thing going on that isnt necessarily bad, but it is rather strong. There is some noticeable alcohol in this one, and that doesnt surprise me with it coming in at 8%. The finish is pretty balancedI guess. It finishes rather abruptly with a bit of syrupy sweetness to try to mask an influx of alcoholic warming that takes over late in the finish.

Opinion: Well, this beer has been a bit better than some of Efes other offerings. This beer is a bit hollow for as big as it is. I think that the gravity was increased by the use of adjuncts, and in this case a bit too much. If this is all Barley, I would be surprised. I may drink this beer again if it is given to me free again as this one wasotherwise I will stick to something more well-rounded.Jul 01, 2006"
Efes Extra,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,"I nearly shat a brick when I realized that this was 8%abv, it looked so innocent sitting on the shelf between Belgians and barleywines, I picked it up almost on a lark (""hey, Turkey, I can find that on a map..I should buy this beer"").
Bold golden color and snowy white head that quickly dissipates to a skullcap. Nose is balanced with alcohol lace and hint of non malt additives (corn?). Surprisingly, hop character is reasonably decent. Respectable lacing becomes evident as the drink commences.
For the style, which is generally one of the less prestigious ones (as far as rankings on this site, anyway), this is good effort. The alcohol is a little strong but the basic but good malt and hops make this go down smooth and satisfying. Something of a nuttiness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a little flat but the texture is pretty good overall. 
Too bad I picked this up in Brooklyn, I would definitely go get more soon if it was more local.Apr 28, 2006"
Efes Extra,4.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,"Appearance  This one poured a beautiful bright orange in color with gorgeous yellow hues around the edges and a full, lingering, lacing head.

Smell  The dull grain aroma is heavy and mixed with tons of juicy orange rind. Theres also a stiff alcohol note to announce the style.

Taste  The booze picks up a bit at the taste and the grain is kind of stale, but otherwise this lager delivers on what it promises.

Mouthfeel  This is medium-bodied with a stinging alcoholic bitterness at the very end.

Drinkability  This Turkish ghetto juice went down OK.Sep 30, 2005"
Efes Extra,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,"The combination of a beautifully rich-but-not-overdone maltiness, and perfumey, floral and spicy hops makes this one a winner! 

It pours a clear, brass-colored body beneath a full head of creamy off-white foam that holds well and leaves rings and sheets of lace about the glass.

The nose is mainly malty, grainy and lightly sweet, with a nutty side. Floral and spicy hops back it up, and there's a suggestion of alcohol there as well, but it never actually manifests itself.

The mouth is supple, smooth, and bordering on becoming creamy with a full body and a fine-bubbled, moderate carbonation that just lightly massages the tongue.

Malt again dominates in the flavor, with a nutty and caramelish edge to it leaves it quite intriguing. It's sweetish, but superbly balanced by a solid bitterness; a spritz of drying alcohol; and its spicy & floral hop flavors. It finishes dry with some lingering fruity malt, a wash of drying alcohol, and then some spicy, grassy, and floral hops.

Overall, it's a very nicely done strong lager with a beautiful maltiness and hop character.Aug 06, 2005"
Efes Extra,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.5,"This was a gift from a friend and I know not where she came up with it as no one at the local beer tasting group had seen it in the area. The group is an accomplished set of folks with real beer knowledge and senses. Surprisingly this little number was one of the hits of the evening, perhaps because of its unique placement among superb ales and barleywines.

Poured out hard it forms a massive cream colored head that is moderately longlasting above the dark gold body. Good clarity and quite attractive. The green body imparted a lightly skunked aroma but was very reminiscent of Pilsner Urquell hopping. The flavor imparts an adjunct finish with some noticeable harshness. Smooth body and reasonable drinkability on a hot day.Jun 12, 2004"
Efes Extra,1.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,"Turkey's answer to Olde English 800? The clerk said this is drunk straight from bottle. Well, for a proper review, I poured it in a glass. Hmm, a transluscent liquid copper pours out of this. The head, at first, foams up to a gargantous foam, only to subside to nothing. A ring of lace is left on top where the head reached it's peak. Strong, malt liquor alcohol smell. But around that, the nose detects a good indication of malt, hops, and even a peppery aroma. First taste is very harsh and coarse. The alcohol is evident on the epiglotis(the hangy down thing on the back of the throat). After the second sip, it's not too bad. Strong alcohol flavour, but their is a malt sweetness. It reminds me a little of cheap scotch whiskey. Course, almost granular mouthfeel. Leaves the throat refreshed, though.Mar 15, 2004"
Efes Extra,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,"Well, I didn't think it was so bad. Maybe the Efes brewery in Moscow does a better job with this beer than Efes in Turkey. Maybe my sample benefitted from the fact that I tried a really, really bad Ukrainian strong beer right before it. In any event, I thought it was OK. Came in a tall dark brown bottle with a dark label of nothing but lettering. Ingredients conform to the purity law. Best before 7/31/04, I opened it on 1/23/04.

A hard pour generated a 3 fingered white head that was nice and firm, with plenty of contour, but still managed to fade fairly quickly, leaving just a bit of lace behind. This sat above pale bubbly gold liquid. The nose was sweet and mild, definitely not skunky. The mouth is fairly heave and lightly carbonated. The taste starts smooth and sweet, with barley and corn competing for dominance. This battle is followed by a mild but astringent metallic hoppy bite. The aftertaste was more sweet than bitter, though, much smoother than most of its Soviet cousins. Certainly drinkable.Jan 24, 2004"
Koko Brown,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Another brew from Kona who always rocks. Popping the top I get wafts of roasts malt and coconut. Pours to a root beer brown with a beige head.

Koko Brown,4.75,4.0,3.75,3.5,"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle dated Jan 11 18. Sampled on June 15, 2018.

This is a highly attractive beer with its deep chestnut brown pour with reddish hues under a tremendous, long-lasting puffy tan head. Lacing.

The aroma is sweet to the max with a dose of coconut and cocoa or chocolate in the mix. Low to no hop profile.

Creamy, medium body.

Sweet malts abound in the flavor too but I'd say it tends to have a chocolate-like taste with a mild or nearly muted bitterness to finish. A slightly different take on the standard brown ale.Jun 15, 2018"

Koko Brown,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bottle dated DEC1016. Nonic pint.

A: pours a dark mahogany, fairly translucent at the edges with 2 fingers thick beige head. Good clarity and quite a bit of visible carbonation. Fair lacing and average retention.

S: smells like a solid brown ale; toasted malt, a little sour yeast esters, and yes - coconut. It's faint, but what is there smells like the coconut air freshener my dad had in his car when I was a kid.

T: coconut is immediately present on the initial arrival, which transitions to a very good and drinkable brown. Malty, toasted bread crust, bitter nut skins, mild to moderate sweetness, cocoa, and just as it transitions to mild and quite clean hoppiness (lacks the earthier and more floral hops I tend to prefer in browns) the coconut surges back, lingering after the swallow and well into the finish.

M: lighter end of mid weight; active, but. It excessive carbonation. Quite clean on the finish.

O: this is a lightweight and very satisfying medium brown ale, with coconut flavor added. I love brown ales, and while the base beer here gets a good vote from me, I think the coconut is s gimmick, albeit an interesting one. This would probably pair very well with Chinese food - or better Thai. If I see it on tap at the local tiki bar, definitely will have it again, but it's not one I'll be buying a six pack of any time soon.May 12, 2017"

L: Clear medium brown pour with 1.5 fingers of foamy white head. Falls quickly and leaves modest lacing.

S: Sweet toasted coconut... nutty and earthy... rich malts. Smells pretty darned good.

T/F: Somewhat sweet... toasted is the word I'm looking for with this beer. Somewhat malty and I do love the coconut flavor of this beer. It works well with the grains.

Koko Brown,3.5,3.25,3.75,3.5,"Overall, light tasting for a brown ale. Some coconut and cocoa taste. Really not a big fan of this after the first few swigs. It's too sweet tasting for my liking. If i wanted a macaroon, i'd eat one. Not likely having this one againMar 04, 2017"
Koko Brown,3.75,4.0,4.0,3.75,"Poured into nonic pint. Minute rim of head, some intricate lace. Cola color.

Nose of sweet coconut and roast. 

Taste is largely coconut, sweet but roasted, other bitter nut notes at the end. 

Dry but watery mouth.

A great idea that doesn't quite reach the heights you dream for it. It's not a bad brown at all; the coconut is intriguing and it's light enough for summer; it's also a bit thin and not super nuanced. Fans of brown ale should give it a try, but don't expect it to redefine the style.Feb 24, 2017"
Koko Brown,3.75,4.25,4.25,3.75,"Appearance- Classic for the style, very brown, almost too dark to see through, with a slightly tan head.

Smell- Huge notes of coconut, but it has a tropical and almost boozy smell to it that makes me think of coconut rum. Lots of sweetness and caramel malt on the back-end, and overall just smells delicious. 

Taste- Follows the nose surprisingly well, but more subtle in the sweetness than I was expecting. The coconut is definitely there, along with some chocolate, caramel, and even a hint of roast coffee. Very nice. 

Feel- Very light and smooth in the body for easy drinking. Not a ton of carbonation. 

Overall- A sleeper hit for sure. I'm biased as I LOVE coconut, and especially coconut rum, but this is an amazing brown ale for my palate.Feb 09, 2017"

This one pours a light mostly clear brown, with a small off-white head, and a bit of lacing.

Smells like faintly sweet toasted coconut, a bit of sugary caramel, and not much else. 

I wish this was more full flavored, not only in the coconut department, but also in the everything else department. It's certainly drinkable and tasty but absolutely not anything to write home about. It's got a vague sweetness, with not enough coconut to carry the weak base beer. I'm left hoping for a bit more malt backbone.

This is light bodied, just a bit watery, with a normal level of carbonation.

Taste has notes of dark fruits, bready malts, some light sweetness, and spicy hops on the back end. 

Feel is medium bodied, pretty smooth with a moderate carbonation.

Primator Dark Lager,4.0,3.75,4.0,3.75,"0ml bottle - we don't get a lot of tmavy pivo around these parts.

This beer pours a clear, dark chestnut brown colour, with a teeming tower of puffy, finely foamy, and somewhat creamy beige head, which leaves some decent layered streaky lace around the glass as it rather lazily recedes.

It smells of semi-sweet, bready and doughy caramel malt, a hint of free-range ashiness, bruised apples and pears, a bit of oily nuttiness, faint cocoa powder, and some very tame earthy, leafy, and floral noble hop bitters. The taste is grainy and bready caramel malt, muddled black stone fruit, ethereal bittersweet chocolate, subtle wet char, some bar-top nuts, and more understated leafy, weedy, and grassy green hoppiness.

The carbonation is fairly laid-back in its insouciant frothiness, the body a solid medium weight, and mostly smooth, with just a touch of smokiness taking things down a notch or so here. It finishes off-dry, the malt, cocoa, and dark fruity esters presiding.

Overall - this comes across as adjacent to a prototypical version of the style (Czech Dark Lager, that is, not the generic one listed above). Flavourful, easy to drink, and with a sub-average ABV that would make it a no-brainer for multiple rounds in an ancient pub, sitting at tank-like wooden tables.Jan 16, 2018"

T - It starts out with a cocoa taste that builds into chocolate flavor. It is kind of sweet.

M - Moderate and chalky

O - This was an impulse buy at the local bratwurst shop. I am glad I picked in up. It is flavorful and light. It reminds me of a Kozel Cerny I had a few years ago that I enjoyed. One of the better dark Euro lagers that I have had.Jan 09, 2015"

Thanks to Julie & Ryan for this one!

Dark mahogany copper color when held to the light. Compact layer of velvety foam that seems to subside after a few minutes. Spindly, drippy lacing in the glass. 

Smell is a little bland, vague lager yeast and some light traces of maple or tobacco. 

Light roasted malt, a little prickly from the carbonation, smooth mild coffee and tobacco flavors linger in the aftertaste. Schwartzbier-ish. Light bodied but somewhat substantial, a little watery in the finish, traces of oxidation.

Primator Dark Lager,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,"Another in the Primator line that I happened on by chance. Since this is a Czech dark beer, I'm not sure how to rate this -- I don't believe I've ever had a Czech Dark before.

A -- Clear, deep chestnut color with a dense, light tan head that holds up well.

S -- Rich, toasty, bready malts with a touch of caramel -- even light molasses and finishing with light Saaz hops.

T -- Pretty much the same character as the nose, starting with bready malts that meld into dark bread and molasses flavors (imagine liquid pumpernickel) then into a light Saaz character that balances well with the rich malts in the finish. There's even a mild, underlying roast character and a lightly sweet malt character -- even a light dark fruit character in the aftertaste.

M -- Mouthfeel is soft to dry with a light-medium body.

O -- Sometimes too much Saaz hop can fatigue my palate, but the balance with the toasted and roasty malts -- on top of a very drinkable 4.8 ABV -- makes this a very enjoyable beer.Mar 05, 2012"
Primator Dark Lager,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.

Look – very dark brown, but still able to see through it. About two fingers’ worth of light khaki-colored foam that dissipates somewhat quickly.

Smell – malty, and indeed much like a dark lager. It has a bit of a porter-like smell. With a roasted quality and chocolate notes.

Taste – malty, but with a tinge of bitterness that must come from hops that don’t appear in the taste itself. It tastes dark and bold, with less of a chocolate hint in the taste, but still a bit like a porter. 

Mouthfeel – also like a porter, the Mouthfeel is deceptively thinner than you would think. Here, it’s very well balanced.

Overall – pretty decent brew. Not terribly interesting to think about, but not dull either.Nov 28, 2011"

T- The slightly sweet brown malt with a touch of dark pot caramel and a melanoidin note that grows dominate as the beer warms. The finish is a soft dry bittern green noble hop note. 

M- The medium mouthfeel has a mellow fizz in the finish and no alcohol heat noticed. 

O- This had a lot of the similarities as their double bock but the melanodin and sweetness really start to dominate as it warms and there isn't any alcohol or hops to cut the sweetness.Aug 23, 2011"

It pours a cola brown with a foamy head that leaves cobwebs of lacing.

The smell is interesting, it almost has the smell of ovaltine, but with a slap of bread and honey. The hops, like in the other primator brews, were up front and herbal/grassy/medicinal. In this particular brew, they could have done without the hop in the aroma.

The flavor is okay, the hops are overbearing with herbal character, it kind of ruins the already weak taste.

The aroma is nice, pleasant and fairly stron, toasted whole wheat, caramel, hints of molasses and root beer/spices, earth. It's malty and hoppy, righ, full, anf firm, an excellent aroma for this style.

The taste is full, rich, and complex, yet still light and easy going, with great depth. It has toasted grain, hint of rich whole wheat, earth, caramelised grain, hint of mapple syrup, root beer, full-flavour. It has both sweetness and a little bitterness plus a zesty spicey bite, but the sweetness is a little too strong and the bitterness is very light, the spicey zestiness being the main counterpoint to the sweetness. Dunkels and dark lagers generally shouldn't be very bitter anyway, but it is still just a tad on the overly sweet side.

Tui East India Pale Ale,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.5,"Pours a red-tinged dark amber, with big carbonation bubbles all around. Negligible head, just a bit of fizz that settles to nought. Intriguing colour but totally meh otherwise. 

Smells quite metallic, with a sharp astringent malt-liquor note. Slightly caramelised but it's a bit sickly mediciney sweet, maybe overattenuated or just some simpler sugars added before fermentation, so it's sharp without having malt substance behind it. Not a great complexity to it. Bit unpleasant. 

Taste is similar. Metallic and malt-liquory upfront in spite of low ABV. Sweet but boozey upfront with a big overload of malt, slightly cardboardy. Yeasty on back. Yeah overattenuated, there's quite a malty flavour but it goes nowhere and ends up yeasty. Could use loads more of everything. Like flavour, for instance. 

Not a bad mouthfeel at first; full upfront, coats the mouth. Ultimately very empty though. I say not bad, I think I mean not 'as bad' as the rest of the experience. 

There is a distinct benefit to this beer, which is its use in marketing other beers, because after drinking this you feel like drinking another, better beer to improve your mood, but you also feel like getting drunk so you will have more than one.

Tui East India Pale Ale,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,"A: Very dark tea color, no carbonation, no head. Looks more like ice tea left out in the sun too long with a little bit of ""scum"" on the top.
S: Sweet and a bit syrupy. Like a white port wine spiked with concord grape. Strange for a beer.
T: It is very tea like, with a bit of fruitiness/concord grape and brown sugar. An odd beer. Not really a beer. I could see this in the refreshments section under flavored tea. It's not bad, but just not beer.
M: Barely felt carbonation. Like a fairly flat soda-tea.
O: Not really beer. No bitterness. Strange drink with a beautiful bottle cap.Oct 05, 2011"
Tui East India Pale Ale,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,"Pours out a slightly cloudy yellow with one finger of suds.
Smell is weak pale ale. Not a lot of hop here but the malt is fairly heavy.
Taste is weak IPA. Needs a little more hop.
Mouthfeel is clean but this is a 4%er so not much about this beer is big.
Overall it is a weak attempt.
Thanks Andrew for the bottle, always ready to try new stuff.Sep 19, 2011"
Tui East India Pale Ale,2.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,"Working my way round the local Dan Murphy's I spied this timid NZ India Pale Ale. I've had this drop a few times and my recollection was of something bland and inoffensive so let's find out if my memory serves me correct.

Poured from a 330ml bottle into a plain tulip pint glass.

A: The body is a clear copper colour suggesting a vat conditioned macro filtered brew. Head is foamy white and it dwindled down to an unremarkable thin lacing. Nothing exciting here.

S: Aroma is yeasty with an apple over tone and malt grains on the back note... if the hops are there they must be playing a minor role in this brew (which is disappointing for an IPA).

T: Very grainy, not a good grain taste either (like in a wheat beer) but more of a corn flavour (something you would expect in a macro lager). The yeast adds a sour taste but it's minimal. If I had to describe the taste of this beer with three nouns they would be: corn, yeast and water. ""No hops can I detect, hmmm"" [Yoda voice]. This beer is false advertising, like the many Australian Lagers that have ""Bitter"" in their name this brew has nothing in common with it's ""IPA"" namesake (what were the brewers thinking???).

M: Watery with slight to low carbonation, nothing else to it.

D: Overall this brew is cheap enough for me not to outright condemn it but the false advertising - calling this an IPA, does indeed niggle at me as I write this review. Are my recollections valid though? Bland and inoffensive, spot on! It's easy to drink (too easy mind you) and if I had to pick between it and macro Australian Lagers then fair enough, but otherwise give it a miss.

Food match: The classic ""meat and vege"" will work with this... easy on the gravy though; you want to taste something from the beer.Jun 16, 2011"
Tui East India Pale Ale,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,"nothing special, but not offensive.
Appearance is dark copper colour with fast receding head.
Smell is IDK some vague smell that isnt lager?
Tastes is very light with a tiny touch of hops.
Mouthfeel is average central
Drinkability is not bad, you can slam them down and it doesnt taste chemically, on the other hand it is no artwork, just inoffensive and inexpensive.Feb 14, 2011"
Tui East India Pale Ale,2.5,2.0,2.0,3.0,"Fairly clear copper colour with a non-existent head. Disappointing.

The aroma is slightly sweet with a touch of metal. There is not hop character.

Sweet, metallic and not at all appetising. This is more macro kiwi lager than IPA.

Medium-light body with moderate carbonation. Acceptable.

A poor example of an India Pale Ale and really a beer that doesn't stand up.Dec 03, 2010"
Tui East India Pale Ale,2.0,1.5,2.0,3.0,"Pours dark amber with a quickly fading head.
Nose shows dirty malt with lots of vegetal notes and a fair whack of caramel. Faint resinous note.
Flavours aren't so bad, showing caramel amber malt. Unfortunately some of the vegetal notes are still present.
Pretty light body, carbonation is too high.May 20, 2010"
Tui East India Pale Ale,2.0,2.0,1.5,2.0,"30 ml poured into a rocks glass

A-- Poured a dark amber color. No head, no lacing, decent carbonation. Nothing exciting about it.

S-- Faint hops, mostly carmel malt. More sweet smelling than bitter. No pine or citrus smell to this. Closer to an ESB or a bitter than an IPA by smell alone.

T-- HMMMM... Tastes like an amber ale. Probably closer to Fat Tire than an IPA. Has a bit of an apple taste to it. No real bitter taste and more sweet than anything else. At least not watery.

M-- Carbonation is good. Just nowhere near an IPA, ESB, APA, or EPA. Faint bite but more of a fruit flavored bite. Once again apple is what I taste and feel. Even the citrus taste is more like apple juice. OK.

D-- Nothing special, even at 4%. If it was reclassified as an amber ale it would be decent and passable. Have had this in NZ and was far better than this. Anyway, still more passable than stuff Fosters or Lion Nathan makes in Australia. If in NZ avoid this stuff and go get some decent stuff from Emersons, Pink Elephant, Twisted Hop, Harrington, or Mac's. Speights is far superior to this.

Note: the grade is more because it is not an IPA, or even close to one.Feb 02, 2010"
Tui East India Pale Ale,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,"I was surprised when I found out this was supposedly an IPA because I didn't think it tasted like one at all, more like a light brown ale. To be honest, it seemed pretty similar to Newcastle, at least closer to that than any IPA I've ever had. There wasn't much in the way of hop character, a slight bitterness perhaps. Most of the beer was dominated by a light malt character with some caramel notes. Definitely seemed adjuncty to me but I may be wrong. Anyway, it's drinkable. I certainly didn't hate it but I don't think I would seek it outside of New Zealand. Worth a try if you're on vacation there though.Sep 11, 2009"
Tui East India Pale Ale,3.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,"Stubby 330 ml bottle with a bright blood red cap and an eye catching orange and red label. On this label is a Tui bird on a tree branch and the word ""Tui"" in bold white letters. The back label has a picture of the founder, a brief bio on him, barcode, and a best before date of June 09. Just in time!

I poured this beer into a standard Victory pint glass. This IPA poured a semi clear pure amber color. No highlights anywhere. It was just a simple pure amber color. On top of this beer was a minimal fizzy head of white foam. It OK retention that left behind a string of white rings and a few spots of lace.

To be honest, there wasn't much of an aroma. I only received a hint of toasted malts and a gentle touch of black licorice. When it was swirled around, a faint whiff a red delicious apples emerges from the background. That's it for the aroma folks!

There wasn't much to the taste either. The taste was lightly malty with the taste of some lightly toasted caramel malts, carbonated water, and a tiny speck of red delicious apples. As the beer moves along, the taste will get maltier, but then all of a sudden the malts just stop at a low to medium amount. Since this was a Pale Ale, I thought I would get some hops in the taste, but they were nowhere to be seen anywhere in the taste.

This was a light bodied beer with plenty of carbonation and a faint aftertaste of carbonated water and toasted malts.

There's not much to this beer, but I could actually this as a lawnmower beer or regular session beer. It's easy to drink a few of these in a sitting, but I wouldn't. The taste of the malts were on the weak side and there was no sign of the hops. A good friend picked up a six pack of this for me in New Zealand.Jun 12, 2009"
Tui East India Pale Ale,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.0,"A- Moderate Brown with average carbonation, it looks average. There is a limited and rapidly disappearing head.

S-Limited malt and hop notes. The notes are muted and you have to hunt.

T- A light ale with the taste of bitters. This is not the Americanized IPA that many of us are use to. Rather a taste that in the US would be called British Bitters. There are hardly any standout malt flavors. However the general neutral tone of everything besides the hops goes together well. The beer is not really that filling and there was a fair amount of carbonation. 

D- See above. It has the same characteristics that mimic cheap American Ales. However the price is right and is decent for a session.Mar 04, 2009"
Tui East India Pale Ale,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,"Very little head even with a vigorous pour. A light cover is retained. Dark amber in colour.

Muted aromas and certainly not the hoppiness that I would expect from an IPA. Some floral notes perhaps.

Quite sweet on the palate. A bit yeasty. Nothing really interesting.

Very light and and easy drinking.

Pretty good for the price, I would rather it than something from CUB, but not a lot to it. Refreshing on a hot day.Dec 16, 2008"
Redhook Long Hammer IPA,3.5,4.0,3.25,3.25,"Copped a 12 pack of 12oz cans for the low, packaged on 7.8.20. I am already very familiar with the west coast ipa style, often piney, cedary, citrusy and drier.

L: Crystal clear light caramel, srm 9. A stiff off-white head with large bubbles. Active carbonation visible. Head dies in a minute or so. The transparency is shocking

S: Pine jumped right out of the can as I cracked it supported by a more floral citrus, not juicy. Stale bread crusts balance out the nose. The intensity is to a large degree.

T: Earthy, piney base with grapefruit sour notes. Bitterness not detected until the finish. Ranged mid to back of the palate. A little heavy on malt flavor here.

F: Rather crisp but the dark bread crumbs shut that down. Oily, medium-light body. Drinkable.

Long Hammer is one of Washington's most favorable west coast ipas. I understand why. It taste like a dewy forest but with hints of citrus so often found in ipas. This citrus was more like the orange plant than the fruit itself. It is easy to throw back but I am not sure I'd want to drink more than two of these in a light, it would get boring. However, overall a standard representation of the WCIPA.Dec 02, 2020"

Taste- Similar to the aroma. Citrus and pineapple, faint melon, some vegetal funk, sweet malt and pine, moderate lingering hoppy bitter finish. decent balance.

Feel- Medium bodied, dryish side and pretty crisp. Medium carbonation on the tongue.

Redhook Long Hammer IPA,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.5,"I didn’t know what to expect from this beer as the reviews weren’t that outstanding - but let me tell you, having drunk it I think that it is seriously underrated.
It smells very nice! Very fruity, citrusy, it’s almost like Sunkist! No kidding, it reminds me of ripe oranges, blood oranges maybe? Anyway, like my wife tells me, it’s like “fruit beer.” Again, seriously: I had numerous IPAs that were brewed with grapefruits or mangoes or oranges et cetera but none of them came close to being this fruity - and this one doesn’t even include real fruit!
The body is kind of light and really crisp, from the beginning to the end. Absolutey no bitterness and even the hop feel is like oranges. I am surprised by this beer because it might not be the most complex IPA out there, it still delivers something that many others can’t. It gives you a helluva good time.
I absolutely loved this beer and would drink it again and again!
Ps. my first beer from Seattle, first beer from Washington state - is everything this good up there?Dec 30, 2019"
Redhook Long Hammer IPA,3.25,1.75,3.75,3.25,"This is a very simple, balanced but pleasant IPA. It is a severely underrated IPA since I normally find it at an affordable price point($1.49 normally). Sweeter than most IPAs I drink and not overly hoppy where it becomes distracting.

The color is beautiful. Dark, brownish- orange amber color. Not much to the smell, minimal lacing but it is robust.

This is an IPA when you’re undecided on which IPA to go with. More of a starter IPA for the uninitiated and for someone looking for a quality, sessionable beer. 

Mild grass notes. A little bit of pine, mild tartness and super faint lemon peel. Touch of honey on the back note but none of the flavors are overly pronounced. This is vanilla but a good quality vanilla. It’s not your overly offensive, knock you on your feet, hopbomb type IPA. This is a “4 quarters of football, I’m gonna drink 10 of these,” type of IPA. And at the price, that’s where it belongs.

You’ll easily grow to enjoy this and I find it everywhere. The Budweiser of IPAs.

And yes, that is a compliment. Cheers!Jul 21, 2019"

T - Definitely fruity notes, then into some snappy bitter hopping. Subtle perfumed peach notes right at the tail-end. 
F - It's very refreshing for a 6.2%, and it doesn't convey as a beer of quite that strength. I like it's balance too, it comes together nicely, with nothing I note standing out of place.
O - It has presence, I reckon you'd have to be pretty hard-boiled to session this. I like it and am glad I tried it, though at the price I'm unlikely to buy it again.

Look - light yellow not quite straw colored. Medium foam head with only light lacing. Only moderate carbonation.
Smell - Not very strong, get the pine, fruit, some grains wheat perhaps. Very moderate for an IPA, no strong hop aroma.
Taste - lots of malt and bread. Can actually taste the alcohol a bit but its not too overwhelming or anything. Very little bitterness, do pick up more sweetness than hops. There is a strange spice note, almost like cloves or cinnamon. Nothing major but it does kind of taste like apple pie. But the major flavor is of malt, wheat bread, slight pine, slight citrus, and brown sugar. It's weird because i like it but it just isn't very pale...
I'm not sure what they were going for with this one. It's sweet. It tastes decent. But it lacks the IPA flavor I'm looking for. This beats macro lagers for flavor but loses to most IPA's.

Redhook Long Hammer IPA,4.0,2.75,3.25,3.5,"Bottle, Nov, 2017:
Pours a darker golden; quite clear with maybe the slightest bit of haze. Head isn't huge, but revives easily, some lacing.

Nose has a bit of a stale beer note to it. Piney in a slightly wooden sense, there's a does of dry shredded wheat cereal in a box to it. It's not the newest bottle, but it's not too enticing at this point.

The taste is a little more balanced. There is still that grainy cereal malt opening and backbone, but a decent does of pine wood bitterness joins it early. The two form an earthy, damp fall morning flavor. As it warms a little citrus (orange) comes out to accent, but it's mostly one-noted. A medium to medium light body, it's just a little flat, and there is a lingering bitterness.

So not a bad beer overall, the nose was really sort of a shock and disappointing. The rest of the beer was about as expected.Feb 24, 2018"
Redhook Long Hammer IPA,4.0,3.5,4.5,4.75,"I will just say up front that I am not a big fan of IPA's because they sometimes can be way overhopped. At least, to me, as that is not my thing. And this beer isn't. To me, its hoppiness is just right so not only do I taste hops (in a moderate amount) but a lot of other flavors as well including some sweetness and maltiness (which admittedly I tend to favor). So I think if your palate runs similar to mine, you will like this beer. Very smooth for an IPA and in no way overpowering. It kept a nice head and the orange and spice flavors complemented each other. Probably a lot more than that going on, I am still new to reviewing beer! I'll definitely drink it again.Feb 11, 2018"

Anderson Valley Hop Ottin IPA,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,"One of the problems with this brewery is that there isn't an identifiable production date. It's hard to get an accurate review when I'm not sure of the age of the beer. Nonetheless, this was one of my first favorite craft beers going back two decades when I first started drinking beer so I ought to give it a review. Purchased in six pack form.

Pours a beautiful reddish copper color with a generous billowy off-white head that graces the top of the glass with filigreed lacing. 

Aroma is initially tea-like. Big dose of caramel malts. Followed by pine, and grapefruit hops. 

This beer still has some hop bite so it must be fresh enough. It isn't wildly bitter but bitter enough for my taste. Taste of fruit, particularly citrus fruit, orange, lemon, and grapefruit. Finishes with a piney hop finish. Not overpowering and the malt backing if tasty.

The mouthful is lasting and pleasant. Light-medium to medium bodied, well balanced and finishes clean.

Overall, I still enjoy this classic IPA and I know the rest of the 6 pack will be pleasant. Cheers!Mar 30, 2020"
Anderson Valley Hop Ottin IPA,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,"One of my old time favorites that I haven't had in years but got a bottle today for old time sake. There is something special about Anderson Valley beers, they have a unique flavor to all of them that is very enjoyable to me. The unique flavor that each beer has gives me a comforting feeling, kinda like the smell of walking in your mom's house, or remembering an old girlfriend's perfume. There's just something that they use in their brewing that does this for me. 

That said, this IPA is solid. It's not too hop forward and has more of a malt backbone to it than most. That's all you really need to know about it, it's good but not ground breaking, but it's reasonably priced. Try it, I doubt you'll be disappointed, but you probably won't be amazed.

Anderson Valley Hop Ottin IPA,3.25,4.0,4.25,3.25,"A damn good IPA all around, it avoids the pitfalls of modern IPAs while giving us something a little skewed but I think some minor things could be tweaked to make it world class.

Pours a nice deep honey Amber with a 1 finger head that lingers for a good 8 minutes. More effervescent than cloudy with a nice aura around the edges of the glass.

Smell is very sweet (more on that later) with a nice hoppy freshness and maybe some citrus on top of very faint biscuit dough.

Tastes of pure sweet malts with a decent hop bite, citrus is there but not overpowering (which I appreciate). I think if the sweetness was dialed back a pinch and a longer dry hop would really launch this IPA into the stratosphere. 

Mouthfeel is perfect, a little oily, thin on the finish and crisp after a good gulp begging you to come back for more.

The sweetness in the Hop Ottin' IPA is well matched with some pretty, dog gone bitter hops, and thank God they're not heavy on Citra and Mosaic like every other IPA in the world, it seems like these days. But there is something about the sweetness in this beer that overpowers the hops. It's like a carnival candy sweetness and accompanying heavy syrupyness that is just too forward for the beer to be refreshing and not-too-filling, which it is. Makes my lips sticky, like an imperial IPA. I like this beer only occasionally because of the sweet heaviness. But I love the hop profile. If they thinned it out and reduced the sweetness while still maintaining the alcohol content, they would have a different beer, and one that I would probably like very much.Jul 21, 2018"
Anderson Valley Hop Ottin IPA,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"From Decervecitas. Bottle. In Teku glass. Playing Life is Strange Before the Storm. 8 months after bff (my fault) Piney and very bitter. Not bad but its noticeable that the hops are old and a bit oxidized. To repeat fresherApr 10, 2018"
Anderson Valley Hop Ottin IPA,4.0,3.75,3.25,4.0,"In my opinion, this is a perfect example of a standard IPA. A couple years ago, I had this brewery's oatmeal stout and I thought that was fantastic, but I didn’t expect their IPA to be so well-balanced. This is easily on par with Laginitas IPA. 

L: Looks rather unassuming. Dark amber body with crater-ridden beige fluff on top. Excellent retention and thick lacing patterns, but any quality IPA with some malt to speak of has this. Lagunitas looks more or less the same (but with less dense head).

A: This is where it steps away from the crowd. Whole wheat bread dominates, with notes of tobacco, black tea, almonds, caramel and sweet apples (Gala, Braeburn, etc.) but a sour hop presence does pervade, bringing orange, passion fruit, plum, and a touch of pine and sage.

T: Again the malt dominates with faintly sweet bread, roasted almond, and oxidized apples, but bitter hops nip the back of the tongue as they go down. Plum, passion fruit, orange and grapefruit rind are noted, as well as that distinct herbal sage character that lingers on the finish along with black tea and the culminating roast.

F: Clean, but not quite crisp. The hoppy bite stops by in the middle of the sip to nip the tongue, but then oxidized vegetable bitterness lingers behind for too long. Finish is more on the creamy side than most mainstream competitors. I like that very much.

O: This is about what I've hoped for every time I have picked up a Red IPA (or IRA). An excellent example of a perfectly malt/hop-balanced single IPA (in the under $9/six-pack range). If you only like malty beer, and think IPAs are not for you, try this one. It might help bridge the gap.Jan 23, 2018"

Anderson Valley Hop Ottin IPA,4.25,3.75,3.0,3.25,"Deep caramel color with amber accents. Head is popcorn colored and 4 fingers tall. A bit darker than I'd like for an IPA (I'm a fan of the lighter shades)

And as I expected with the darker shade comes strong caramel malts and butterscotch. Beneath the butterscotch sweetness is some vanilla, orange, and grapefruit pith. It's a supremely sweet and nice aroma, but I don't trust it!

Citrus forward, with toffee malts, caramel, which only gets louder as it warms. Hops and pine come in strong behind the former. There's nothing infectious with the flavor, it's just overall disgusting - wrought with caramel notes. 

Feel is medium bodied, creamy, and a sticky, dry, tongue scrubbing feel towards the finish. 

Overall, eh, not really fresh tasting. I can see how hopheads and especially fans of West Coast IPA's would enjoy this, but it's not for me.Oct 31, 2016"
Anderson Valley Hop Ottin IPA,4.0,3.75,3.75,3.75," ounce can poured into a pint glass

A: Pours an amber semi-cloudy orange with an off white head, slight lacing, decent amount of carbonation.

T: Like the nose, slight grapefruit rind, pine needles, moderate amount of bitterness in the middle, nicely balanced with the malts, really dry finish.

M: Medium bodied with a very dry finish.

O: It's old, hops are not as prevalent as I was hoping. I can't find this in my area fresh, but if I'm reading the code right this can is from around August, 2016. This probably explains why the hops are not popping, curious know how this taste fresh.Oct 21, 2016"

Smells of orange rind, grapefruit zest, muddled tropical fruit, honeyed brown bread, pine needles, expensive perfume and cut flowers.

Tastes of more bready caramel malt, blood orange, grapefruit flesh, citrus oil, oak and intense piney hops.

Feels big and hearty. Hefty middleweight with solid carbonation. Finishes super dry.

Looks great in the glass. Quite bubbly. Deep amber colour,

Aroma is not the best, and quite carbon dioxidey. Elements of banana coming through.

Tastewise, it's taste reminds me of a French beer. It's like a fusion of Kronenbourg with a typical Belgian amber ale. Quite banananey. 

Improves as it warms up.

Seems a bit too carbon-dioxidey in my view. Not as good as the red, though it was a while since I had!May 24, 2016"
Satan Gold,3.25,3.0,3.0,2.75,"Slightly sour aroma, malty, fruity, peach, a little yeast. Satan Gold is a low-saturated, drunk easily, is delicate notes of yeast in the background. The taste is dominated by peach and bitter ending, which at the moment remains in the mouth.Mar 01, 2015"
Satan Gold,4.0,3.75,3.5,3.75,"I'm going to rewiev this one side by side with the Satan Red, both poured in Orval Chalices and both classified as BSPA at 8.00% ABV. Here we go:

A: Pours clear golden with strong rich small bubbles. The tall head is crystal white and quite creamy. Rich lacings. Looks way better than the Red.

S: Yeast and spice, kind of acidic Semi-sweet malt. Fruity; mainly citric notes. Smell is stronger than in the red one. 

T: Sour, yeast and spices. Sweetness, but rather mild, from the malt. Almost dry and acidic; green apples, citric notes. Much drier and more acidic than the red.

M: Aftertaste is very long and sour. Body is on the medium side and carbonation is low. 

O: Nice and sour. It lacked a little complexity in the taste compared to the smell and look. Not bad but it would probably have gotten a better grade if not compared side by side with the more complex-tasting red one.May 10, 2013"
Satan Gold,4.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,"Thanks to NewBrewBB for the opportunity to try this beer. 750ml bottled served in a tulip. Pours an orange-gold hue with a hazy clarity. Head is one inch, bright white and eventually dissipates into a bubbly froth. Some textured swaths and slashes of lacing present during the tasting. Nose expresses candi sugar, lightly herbal/grassy notes and a suggestion of Belgian yeast. Taste is dull and herbal; almost a little vegetal. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively, almost coarse carbonation. Overall, not bad, but there are much better examples of the style out there.Apr 01, 2012"
Satan Gold,2.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,"A - Dull cloudy orange hue, under a small head with no retention.

Satan Gold,4.5,4.0,5.0,3.5,"Bought this one in Brussels. Tasted in Quebec, Canada.

The beer color is golden yellow with a nice white head that looks like a cloud. It sticks quite well to the glass. The aroma is delicate... I get some floral hops with some herbs and spices. Visually, this one is quite carbonated. Taste presents notes of fruits (mainly apple), with a dry finish. Its very dry. Warms due to the alcohol. Carbonation is noticed in the mouth too.

Very well balanced beer if you ask me. The bitterness is in perfect equilibrium with the sugar. Very good taste. This is an excellent beer. I would say its pretty awesome according to my taste.Feb 19, 2012"

A - Cloudy amber with thick and dense, pillowish head. Indefinite head retention

S – Slightly malty, hint of alcohol.

T – Distinctly malty and bitter, slight sweet carmel after tones.

M – Heavy on the tongue. Sweet mellows to a balance of sour and bitter aftertaste; relatively low carbonation. 

D – I liked the bottle design, but I wasn’t as impressed by the contents. The alcohol content sets me off a bit. I wouldn’t drink more than one of these in a sitting.Sep 11, 2011"
Satan Gold,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,"Pours a cloudy golden straw colour, one finger head that goes too quickly.

(very) Restrained Belgian yeast aromas.

Satan Gold,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,"Pours a clear light golden colour, much like costume jewelry. Head is a pleasant frothy meringue of pure white that collapses in its own airy nothingness. Looks quite refined. Not bad overall.

Nose is pleasantly savoury, with a pleasant sprightly champagne character overarching everything else. Light dustiness and a refined sharp Belgian note. Quite a nice nose overall.

Taste is quite light, but has that pleasant Belgian yeast character drying the palate, and leaving a slightly roasted nut flavour. There's certainly not a huge amount on it, but it's pleasant enough, even though the back palate is slightly too sweet.

Not a bad beer all up. It's certainly very light and extremely drinkable, despite its ABV. I've had far better and far more complex Belgian ales, but this one is a pretty decent one.Sep 25, 2010"
Satan Gold,4.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,"Poured from a 33cl bottle into a chalice.

A - Cloudy amber colour beer with a good finger-worth of soft pillowy head. Excellent head retention and solid lacing. 

S - Hops and grass. Touch of malt and wheat.

T - Slightly bitter at first but with a mellow off-set from the creamy head. Strong phenolic hit. Light malt flavours come through with a sweet aftertaste. Different; but in a good way.

M - Very sweet and sour owing to the combination of bitterness from the brew and the sweetness from the head. 

D - An odd drink but definitely enjoyable. Wouldn't mind a few more to try and truly define the qualities of this beer. 

The combination of sweet and sour here is somewhat unusual so this is definitely a beer worth trying. Slightly different take on the BSPA formula but with all the usual qualities you associate with the style.Jun 12, 2010"

Satan Gold,3.5,4.0,2.5,4.5,"This is a great beer, no dispute. There exists however, one trait that keeps this beer out of the higher echelon. It's distractingly, over-poweringly, unnecessarily sour. A little sourness is perfectly acceptable and even pleasant in many fine ales. Even moderate levels are fine if balanced with the right pH. I just found it too sour to focus on the malt, hop, or ethanol profiles. A shame too, because I would have loved to pour a bottle of Satan for some of my more ""cough"" conservative friends.Feb 07, 2010"
Satan Gold,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.5,"Pours cloudy light orange/gold with a 1 inch foamy white head; smells sweet and malty, with spices, yeast and orange peel coming through. 

Tastes sweet overall, with a combo of malt, spices, citrus, coriander, and some yeast. It finishes dry with the malt and fruit lingering. The beer is smooth with very light carbonation and gets better as it warms. The alcohol comes through in a subtle way that is not overbearing, but allows the sweetness and malt to resurface.

S- belgian yeast and spices. coriander and clove. a little bit of banana. pretty sweet smelling. reminds me of a tripel so far. 

T- overly sweet. very tripel like, as with the smell. clove, banana, and coriander. lots of belgian yeast. its starting to sour at this point. not terrible yet. 

M- thin and watery with a harshly high level of carbonation. tongue stinging. small heat from the alcohol on its way down. 

D- i wish i had someone to split this bottle with, the whole thing was a little much. the off sour flavor and massive amount of sweetness makes this one i wont be coming back to. oh well, you cant win em all. i think its been misclassified and really belongs in the tripel catagory.Jul 03, 2009"
Satan Gold,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,"Satan Gold pours with a good two finger thick head of bright white, and has a golden body, with a mild chill haze look.

The aroma is a mixture of citrusy and white wine like characteristics; perhaps, even a powdery candied sugar fragrance is here too.

The taste is sweet up front with a slightly sour note of hops, but gives way to a sugary bubble gum like finish.

Mouth feel wise, this has a fullness of oily hops and the bite of a good amount of carbonation. This follows through with an alcohol warming feeling.

This is a pretty good Belgian beer. I'd liken it to Duvel, thought this beer I believe is harder to come by.Jun 09, 2009"
Satan Gold,4.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,"Appearance - Gold (duh), 1 finger of head which reduced.

Smell - Sweet fruits, rather lacking in spices.

Mouthfeel - Texture and carbonation both good.

Drinkability - Very drinkable considering the high alcohol content.

Overall - After trying the excellent Satan Red, this was a disappointment. It isn't a very good representation of the style. Try Duvel instead.May 29, 2009"
Satan Gold,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,"Presentation: Drank this at New Amsterdam bar in Dallas, TX. Poured from 12oz bottle into a Chimay chalice glass.

A: This beer pours a murky goldish/brown tending more towards the gold, but strangely murky for the style. I didn't mind it so much, but it was not the most attractive beer I've ever seen. I did not pour it, so the head was only a thin layer on top that stuck around most of the session.

S: Smell is nothing substantial and has no stand out notes, but it was slightly fruity and refreshing.

T: A lot sweeter than I expected. I do like sweetness though so it didn't bother me too much. It was slightly too sweet for even me though which brought its score down. I prefer to be able to pick out what fruit a beer reminds me of, but this one was tough to discern. I liked it better when cold.

M: Crisp, slightly creamy, and nicely carbonated. No complaints here.

D: I found myself enjoying this a lot at first, but as it warmed it got worse. Something I don't typically find with Belgian style ales. I could only drink one of these in a row, but maybe 2 in a night.

Overall given the price and availability factor I might seek this out again. It was a decent representation of Belgian beers, but certainly not up to par with other Belgian breweries or even some top American brewers of Belgian styles. Worth trying though.Mar 30, 2009"
Satan Gold,3.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,"Hazy brownish gold with a thick foamy white head. Head is well retained. A good sheet of lacing is left as I drink. Bottle gushed when I cracked it costing me a small amount of the beer.

Smells of apple juice, almost exactly like the juice I had given to my daughter today. A little bit of Belgian yeast aroma, making it just a bit earthy.

A little bit of apple right at the front, then the flavour becomes a bit more citric. Solvent like alcohol mixes into the back half. A bit of woody funkiness throughout. It is an odd mix, one that doesn't really agree with my palate.

Body and carbonation are pretty normal for the style but there is a bit of filmy feeling left on the tongue wherever I taste the solvent liquor flavour.

Not the worst beer I've had, but not one I would suggest to anyone unless they've run out of Belgian brews to try.Jan 08, 2009"
Satan Gold,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,"Pours a cloudy golden color with one finger of white head.

Whistler Whiskey Jack Ale,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.25,"Can into 8-oz tumbler. Pours a clear, rather pretty deep amber color. Not much in the way of head, though.

Whistler Whiskey Jack Ale,3.0,3.0,2.75,3.0,"Pretty much an ordinary brew in most ways, however, as it warms up it heads towards tasting like wet cardboard. Has an odd chemical character.

Whistler Whiskey Jack Ale,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,"330 mL bottle, the last remaining from a Whistler Brewing mixed 12-pack sampler that I picked up at TBS about two weeks ago. Served well-chilled.

Pours a crystal clear reddish amber colour, with one finger of frothy off white-coloured foam floating atop. It dissipates steadily over the next two minutes or so, leaving a modest collar along with some soapy patches of froth on the surface; minimal lacing. A little too dark for an English pale - I reckon it's more of an American (Canadian) red ale, if anything. Nothing of real note to report on the nose... very subdued, with notes of bready grains, biscuit, caramel and mild, tea-leafy hop character. OK thus far.

The taste follows the aroma, both in terms of its comprising elements and the resultant lack of complexity. Fairly malt-forward, with caramelized sugar and toffee sweetness interacting with the bready, grainy malt backbone. Light orchard fruit sweetness, followed by more leafy, earthy hop bitterness of the sort you'd find in an English-style pub ale. Finishes with a hint of lingering malt sweetness. Light-bodied, with carbonation levels that are about right for an American amber, but a little too crisp, lively and biting for an English pale.

Final Grade: 3.2, a C+. Whistler Brewing's Whiskey Jack Ale is an uninspired, plain sort of red ale that borders upon mediocrity, if not managing to outright exemplify it. It lacks technical flaws, but the bland, somewhat saccharine flavour profile mostly just rubs me the wrong way. Though it might possibly work as an introductory craft beer, it's still a forgettable product and probably my least-favourite of the four different brews included in the sampler (the others being their Powder Mountain Lager, Bear Paw Honey Lager and Paradise Valley Grapefruit).Nov 14, 2016"

Pours dark amber, with small but dense light beige head. Rather thin in both aroma and flavor. Grainy smell with a touch of hops. Taste of some caramel malt, some graininess, and some bitterness at the end, but subdued. 
Medium body, soft carbonation. 
Just Ok, not much going on here.

Tried on-tap, one of the only non-big-beer options.
As above, decent enough, but pretty subdued and mild in smell and taste.Mar 17, 2014"
Whistler Whiskey Jack Ale,3.0,2.5,2.75,3.25,"Served in a chilled pint glass

Appearance: dark amber color. Minimal lacing on pour, head dissipated rather quickly.

Smell: lacking. Esther notes, slightly pine. Pick up more on the bready notes

Taste: notes of corn, almond, and toast sourdough. Minimal hop flavor, slight citrus notes of unripe peach. 

Mouthfeel: crisp, slight stickiness. Minimal alcohol backing, no noticeable burn

Overall: disappointing. Lacking an identity. While just a pale ale, it missed the mark on the style with very minimal hop flavor. Very easy to drink thoughJan 09, 2014"
Whistler Whiskey Jack Ale,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,"30ml bottle. My mind, when hearing the word 'whiskey', in reference to beer, jumps by default to the barrel treatment sort. No such luck here, as apparently the marketing, and perhaps other, folks at Whistler prefer their bird-watching instead.

This beer pours a clear, bright medium copper amber hue, with three fingers of puffy, loosely foamy, and fizzy ecru head, which settles quickly and steadily, leaving a bit of sudsy mitochondrial lace in places around the glass. 

It smells of mildly biscuity caramel malt, a bit of dry wheat cracker, a soft orchard fruitiness, and earthy, somewhat musty hops. The taste is semi-sweet, blandly fruity caramel malt, some further wet cracker notes, a touch of wan citrus pith, a slight metallic edge, and more weakly bitter earthy, musty hops. 

The carbonation is average overall, if a bit frizzante here and there, the body an anemic medium weight, and a tad too pithy to proclaim as outright smooth. It finishes fairly off-dry, the caramel malt still large and in charge, though tempered by an edgy, flinty nature, as opposed to the proclaimed bitter hop suspects.

Not a bad Canadian amber ale, but just a bit too sweet and subsequently unbalanced to seriously be considered as an APA - the hops, if they were indeed there to begin with, seem to have just up and flew away, in the manner of the titular 'winged friends'.Dec 13, 2011"

Whistler Whiskey Jack Ale,4.0,2.0,2.5,3.0,"Pours clear and bright; a sort of redish brown. 2-3 fingers of head - didn't last very long.

Certainly tends toward the darker side of pale ales.

Right out of the gate I smelled burnt sugar, or roasted marshmallows, and that impression carried through to the taste. The bottle says ""A perfectly ballanced brew."", but the malt really dominated this beer. Sort of cloying. 

I can't even recommend it for people who really like malty beers, due to its...oddness. Burned sugar.

I'd never buy it again.Jul 06, 2011"
Whistler Whiskey Jack Ale,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Just picked up a cool mixed 12 pack from Whistler Brewing, looks like a retro suitcase complete with period stickers. The Whiskey Jack ale is most likely the rebranded pale ale. The colour is on the darker side with a huge head. Nose is slightly malty but with hops coming through after it warms up. Solid mouthfeel with a malt presence but enough hops to make it interesting. More complex than say GI or OK Springs Pale Ale and bigger on the finish.

Westmalle Trappist Dubbel,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.25,"Celebrating the end of a months long project with a new brew. Attractive bottle with the Trappist Bier ring near the cap, Dark label and bottle to protect the beer (I presume). 
Pours thinner than a quad but the same rich and sweet aroma of molasses and candy. Carbonation is brighter than I expected and a layer of lace. I usually pour in one great forcing of the beer into my glass (an Averbode chalice). Seems to get air into the beer and release the carbonation. Head sticks around as a light layer throughout the entire quaff. 
Velvet going down, aftertaste of sweetness, light ABV and a dense mixture of candied marmalade, figs and and a light banana essence.

Caramel is prominent, quite spice heavy to balance with white pepper and a hint of clove. Very mild bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a big carbonation and average drinkability. Dubbels are far from my favorite Belgium style but this is obviously an excellent example of the style (one of the originators). Definitely worth the occasional revisit and quite enjoyable.

Westmalle Trappist Dubbel,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.75,"Oh good Lord. I've been looking for this one for a while now, Trappist beers are not readily available across BC. What is there to say ? I purchased this beer along with it's Tripel sister and a St.Bernardus ABT 12. I brought my treasure back home and proceeded to teach all of my roommates about Trappist beers, everyone had to know what I had found. I sat down and prepared myself: this is going to be intense. I have no expectations, so it's impossible to be disappointed. The moment of truth: the pour. Thick caramel/red with almost no carbonation, I don't know how long it aged in the bottle but that was a good sign for me. I can smell the malt from all the way over here. Some kind of powerful alcohol smell hits me in the face like a truck. Holy Dubbel Beer, Batman! The flavor! Oh the humanity! I have been waiting a long time to taste this. Instantly, malt, caramel, grain, all at once, some dark chocolate in there, some kind of red fruit, and the taste left in my mouth reminds me of afternoons with my dad at the local Tobacconist. Dang boy. That was intense. I think I converted my wife to Belgian beers as well because she's been asking for more.
All in all, an amazing beer. There's a love and a passion that's palatable in these kind of beers, beers that have been made by people who truly love their craft.

Westmalle Trappist Dubbel,4.75,4.0,4.25,4.25,"*Poured into a Teku glass from a 11.2oz bottle*

This beer poured a dark purple/brown with a pillowy tan head which was about a finger thick. This had a moderate retention to it which led to a satisfying drinking experience.

Mostly malt forward, I found that the aroma consisted of sweet malts and caramel upfront. These sweet aromas were followed by some esters like pears and some dark fruit like: pears, plums, plum wine which were coupled with a bit of spicy peppery phenols.

This beer had a sweet caramel taste upfront which then evolved into flavors of dark fruits ranging from cherries, raisins, and plums. This then finished with a pleasant taste of toast coupled with a peppery spiciness. I'm not sure how old this beer is, but I assume kind of on the older side since I tasted a lot more dark fruit than I anticipated.

I felt like the alcohol taste on this was very low to mildly perceived. This also felt medium-bodied and had a high amount of carbonation to it all adding to its overall drink-ability. The toast aftertaste was pleasant but not overwhelming or long lingering.Jun 02, 2020"

smell: not the most fragrant beer for the style but it still sure smells good, lots of malt flavour, some roasted smokey smells, a lot of sweetness, toffee, plum, banana, clove, vanilla, a touch of pear maybe, a hint of some more tart fruit flavours, definitely a bitterness to it, smells quite inviting.

taste: lovely, all those malt flavours explode at first along with the rush of carbonation, they’re smokey, oaky, nutty, then a sweetness takes over that’s rather fruity, some orange and lemon there, lime, banana but also darker fruits, mainly plum, some fig too, for me the finish is the best though, a real smokey and herbal and floral aftertaste after a nice hit of bitterness, somewhat reminiscent of a peaty whiskey, it’s very nice indeed.

feel: medium bodied, highly carbonated, has a champagne like dryness to it along with a nice warming of the back of the throat, quite drinkable although it’s alcohol is not hidden.

overall: although it is perhaps the mildest trappist ale i’ve ever had, it’s certainly a very nice one, a great beer.May 29, 2020"

Westmalle Trappist Dubbel,4.0,4.0,4.25,3.75,"Aroma is sweet bread, plums and raisins, spice.

Color is dark brown from the front, murky ruby red with a back light. 1/3 inch tan head from a careful pour into the chalice, thick, creamy, uneven top, excellent retention. Thick sheets of lacing on the opposite side. Upward showers of bubbles.

Taste is somewhat bitter in the beginning, and this remains in the background throughout. Dark fruits, raisins, mild spiciness. The taste is fairly complex, with the interplay of fruit, spice, and a dry bitterness that borders on astringency. The bitterness is more like bitter coffee (albeit with no coffee taste) rather than bitter hops. The finish is surprisingly toward dry, given the sweetness of the aroma.

Jever Pilsener,3.5,4.75,4.5,4.0,"Underrated pilsner. Almost a Hallertau hop bomb (within the bounds of the type) with a nice layered malt depth for balance.

Looks correct, nothing to get excited about, the head is creamy with lacey lacing. Smell is redolent of noble hop. I guess you either like it or you don't. I do. The malt is in the background. There is a dank skunk note which every Jever I've ever had, in the US or the EU, possessed which I take to be the hops used. I find the Kushy notes endearing.

Straw colored body, with mostly clear clarity. One finger of white head upon pouring, which hung on as a thin cap and ring. Only a few spots here and there of lacing.
Aroma of biscuit malts and grassy hops. Also expresses the skunk.
Taste is slightly bitter from start to finish, with cracker malts and grassy hops. Dry finish.
Thinner mouth feel. Excellent carbonation.

Jever Pilsener,4.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,".2 oz bottle served in a Bitburger Rastel 0.2l Pokal glass. Packaged on 02.07.2019. Enjoy by 02.10.2020. 

Appearance: Clear, bright golden yellow with a persistent thick white head and lots of lacing. Great looking beer. 

Smell: Lots of noble hops, a bit of green apple, and a hint of skunkiness that you would expect with a green glass beer. 

Taste: Lots of noble hop bitterness from start to finish with a bit of malt (sometimes bready, sometimes cracker-like) in the middle. 

Mouthfeel: Sticky on the teeth, dry finish. Good carbonation. 

Overall / Drinkability: Definitely more hoppy for for a pilsner with lots of bitterness involved. Easily drinkable and went well with corn tortilla bean & cheese tacos. I would not mind having a full 0.5L of this beer. A very well crafted German Pilsner.Dec 08, 2019"
Jever Pilsener,4.25,4.5,4.5,3.75,"I really beat myself to s**t with all of those Stouts following NBS (Week 746) & as a result, I find myself on a Lager kick for the time being. What the hey, it's all in furtherance of The CANQuest (tm)! 

From the CAN: ""Imported Premium Beer Brewed in Germany""; ""German Quality, Jever Refinement""; ""Crisp Bitterness, Hoppy Flavour, Dry Finish.""; ""Brewed in strict accordance with the 'German Purity Law'."" 

What a find! I have drank Jever Pilsener many times, but I have never seen it CANned before now. Usually, it comes in Bottles, although I've had it on draught a couple/few times. 

I beCAN by Crack!ing open the vent & following that with a gentle C-Line Glug. I was rewarded with the unbidden creation of just better than two fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, bone-white head with excellent retention. Color was a gorgeous Golden-Amber (SRM = > 5, < 7) with NE-quality clarity. This roused The Gelt Gang of Croesus, Mammon & Midas from last night's stupor to come into the kitchen & join me for a taste. Nose was magnificently malty, very bready & biscuity with a pleasant Noble hop character of grass, hay & alfalfa. I CANnot understand the relatively low rating numbers since this is like the poster child for the style! Mouthfeel was kinda weak, not exactly thin & watery, but close. Oh well. The taste had a honey-like quality from the malt that was balanced nicely by the sharpness of the hops. It reminded me of Summers at my maternal grandparents, lying in the freshly-mown grass as the nearby working farm worked on their crops while my grandmother baked biscuits for supper. leaving them to cool on the windowsill while I read comic books. Sigh. Finish was absolutely dry! It was a pleasant dryness, though, not the gasping dryness that causes me to reach for my asthma inhaler. Now that I know that it exists in CANs, it becomes a good CANdidate for my beach-bound cooler this Summer … if I CAN just remember where I scored it in the first place. 8=( YMMV.Jun 14, 2019"

Meantime Wheat,2.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,"I just had to try a hefe on cask. 

a: This was the appropriate cloudy golden wheat color. It was served to me with a few big bubbles for a head.

s: Pretty much spot-on for the style with lots of bananas and bubblegum plus a hint of clove.

t: Plenty of semi-tart bananas up front with a drier clove bit at the end.

m: I don't think the cask was quite at its prime, but for a stlye I associate with heavy carbonation this worked pretty well.

T - Similar to the aromas, banana, cloves and wheat are the prominent taste, light and sweet finish with a brief sweet aftertaste. 

M - Medium body, medium carbonation, smooth finish.

O - Overall quite a pleasant beer to sit and enjoy. Possibly a little sweet for a session beer, but certainly one to appreciate.Jun 11, 2011"
Meantime Wheat,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,"My 100th review on here so it's fitting it should be a hefeweizen.

A terrific golden orange colour that cloudy as expected. The lack of a good head was a slight disappointment.

A pleasant & unique combination of banana and toffee that works well together & is rounded off nicely with spices & cloves at the back. Refreshingly pleasant & well balanced.

The taste of wheat & banana make up the main flavours of this beer & work well without being outstanding. There is a nice hint of toffee in there too which is different whilst still tasting like a hefeweizen.

Plenty of fizz and carbonation to this one, it is light bodied but could do with being more crisp in the finish.

This was a nice, enjoyable hefeweizen but definitely not the best I've tried. It works on some levels but the alcohol content can be tasted through the banana flavouring, in addition to this the lack of a head was a real let down.

Meantime Wheat,3.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,"A 330ml bottle with a BB of Nov 2011. Rear label mentions that a strain of Bavarian yeast is used in the brewing of this wheat beer.

Poured into a Guinness pint glass; bottle was swirled towards the end to ensure the yeast was fully suspended. A cloudy, almost opaque golden-amber hue. Fine carbonation is visible at the edge of the glass. Produces a thick creamy head of white foam, although this subsides quite quickly. A complex aroma of yeasty sourness, fruity esters, bananas and cloves - fantastic!

Taste is pleasingly sour, with extra bite from the carbonation. Notes of yeast, fruit esters, bananas and cloves all mingling on the palate. A flavour smorgasbord! Mouthfeel is very smooth and velvety, with prickliness from the CO2 (this fades after a while). Faint sour yeast aftertaste.

A lovely hefeweizen - subtly acidic with lots of yeast flavours contributing to the taste. A good match for genuine German hefes, and worth your time if you come across it.Mar 10, 2011"
Meantime Wheat,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,"A clouded copper toned brew with lots of small bubbles, a white fizzy head that leaves no lacing.

A smell of yeast, oranges and spices, in that order.

The taste has a pure initial sweetness, then some bitter orange sourness and bitterness, a spicy character like cloves and cumin.

Rather high carbonation, lively bubbles, a refreshing feeling. The finish is dry.

Not bad, a bit sweet for being the perfect summer refresher. But fits nicely in a cooler and damper climate.Oct 01, 2010"
Meantime Wheat,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,"30ml brown bottle poured into a Hoegaarden Witbier glass.

A. A brown/amber cloudy beer with a creamy head that shrank to a depth of approximately 2mm and sat on top of the beer.

N. Similar to the Hoegaarden, spicy notes with curacao knocking at the door plus a hint of banana and cloves.

T. Warming spicy clove notes dominate with banana. A touch of creaminess joins in the blend too.

M. Smooth, clean and easy drinking.

A- Cloudy yeasty pale blonde with 3 finger head after aggressive pour. Head reduces very quickly, lacing is average.

S- The banana quality in the nose is fantastic, so fresh. Some clove notes.

T- Lots of banana again, fading to a faint bitterness, every so slightly thin finish. The banana lingers on. Maybe some youghurt creaminess.

M- Medium to high carbonation, light, spritzy, but a bit thin.

D- The banana element is delicious in the nose and tongue but appearance is letting it down. If the beer had a little more body to it, it would be a winner as the smell is excellent. Still very refreshing and easily drinkable.Apr 09, 2010"

A: orangeish brown and cloudy beer with a relatively thin head.

S: a touch of orange zest, and a powdery/dry smell.

T: I keep trying Meantime products really hoping to like them but so far, I've been a bit disappointed. Wheat is ok. Just ok. The scent and initial taste on the tongue promises a lot but doesn't deliver on the finish.

M: mouthfeel was weak as well, not quite enough bite to keep my attention.

D: would definitely give this a second chance . . .Apr 04, 2010"
Meantime Wheat,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,"Poured into an Old Speckled Hen pint glass. Pours with a very small head which dissipates extremely quickly. No lacing, looks quite disappointing, very little head, but at least the color is a nice golden wheat yellow.

Smells quite decent - quite a bit of banana, clove and wheat, very little bit of hop spiciness.

Tastes a lot blander than the smell - a bit of banana and estery flavors which really are secondary to the quite prominent yeasty flavor. It's not very intense, a decent imitation of a hefeweizen but too light and weakly flavored to be anywhere near a good hefe.

The mouthfeel is too carbonated, drinks moderately easily but far too gassy to really be enjoyable. Decent, but really not that great as a hefeweizen.Mar 08, 2010"
Meantime Wheat,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,"Pours dead, flat, and a reasonably cloudy light amber.

Smell is hay and banana..

Slightly spicy. Quite restrainted spice, no real hops but a light, dry finish. A very subtle hint of barnyard-ish yeast is probably the best thing going on here. In total, not a lot happening, but quite unoffensive.

Thin watery body and minimal carbonation.

Honestly, this is completely unoffensive, not interesting, but not bad. Could pound these all night.Feb 14, 2010"
Meantime Wheat,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,"Poured into Hefe Weiss style glass, decent dense white head, typical of Wheat beers, though body not as cloudy as some. Aroma typical of German style Hefe Weiss beers, though less pronounced as the best - cloves, fruity and banana's. 

Taste similar to the German style (and probably the best UK brewed German Weiss style I have tasted) though slightly sweeter finish than most German Weiss beers. No great depth of flavours however, and a light finish - making it less satisfying than the best of the German's.

However, for a UK brewed German style Weiss beer, think it's a decent job and would have it again, though not in preference to Schneider, Wehenstephener, Erdinger, Maisels or Andechs etc!

Poured into a Corsendonk badged, stemmed tulip glass. A small amount of sediment sat within the glass, but the beer was almost crystal clear, golden and lively. A white head left before it could settle, leaving a wisp and collar.

The aroma was of yeast and peaches, not the normal banana and vanilla smells associated with this style. Nothing wrong with that, except the label claimed banana, cloves and toffee smells.

Wheat flavoured in the taste, fairly dry for the style, yeasty too.

Not overly impressed I'm afraid, the 5% ABV is evident, but it doesn't do anything to add any substance to the beer.Nov 06, 2009"
Meantime Wheat,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,"Appearance: Honey coloured and cloudy. Pours with a medium white head, although it has poor retention. 

Aroma: Grainy wheat, with a slight sweetness. Orange, and possible a hint of honey or maybe toffee.

Taste: The initial flavours are citrus, followed by a hint of sourness. After this there are sweet toffee flavours combined with a sugary biscuitiness, ending the beer with a lingering sweet graininess. 

Mouthfeel: Fresh. and crisp, with a mild sharpness. 

Drinkability: Not the best beer I have had from the Meantime brewery. It is very refreshing but it lacks something in the flavours. Unfortunately, this is just an average offering from an otherwise fantastic brewery.Sep 07, 2009"

Coopers Original Pale Ale,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,"Coopers Original Pale Ale. The Original, and the best. Coopers Pale was my introduction into the pale ale scene, and the craft beer scene. Whilst not a 'craft beer' per se, it's an excellent style of the Australian Pale Ale, and has stood the test of time to not only be one of Australia's finest beers, but one of my favourites. It's my go-to when there's nothing else, because it never lets you down. This is going to be a bit biased, but it's one of my favourite beers. 

Look - 5/5: Poured off tap or out of a bottle for this review, it looks great. The natural sediment in the bottle gives the beer this wonderful hazy, murky, ochre orange colour, and is as cloudy as a London summers day. The head starts off fairly nicely packed, a little soap sudsy, before dissipating into a thin foam. 

Smell - 5/5: For me, it smells amazing. As mentioned earlier, it was my introductory beer into the pale ale scene, and it's kind of like that smell of home. Always brings a smile to the face. Orange, mandarin, and lemony citrus notes, a slight malt character, Smells refreshing, ready to be drunk. 

Taste - 4/5: It's a common introductory beer for those entering into the pale ale scene, because it's inoffensive, and it's not going to smack you around with overly bold flavours. A nice earthy malty sweetness, with fruit notes lingering around the mouth,. The finish has a nice smooth bitterness that doesn't poke holes in the taste buds courtesy of the Pride of Ringwood hops that are more common in your Australian lagers, but compliment an Aussie Pale nicely.

Feel - 4/5: It's quite carbonated, but well balanced. Super refreshing on a hot summers day ice cold out of the esky or the fridge. 

Overall - 4.5/5: Some find it boring, but as mentioned, I popped my Pale Ale cherry to this piece of, South Australian culture. It's never failed on a session, it's never failed to quench my thirst. It's bigger cousin, Coopers Sparkling Ale may have more oomph, but it's a classic easy drinking beer, that puts a smile on my dial.Aug 20, 2021"
Coopers Original Pale Ale,3.0,3.25,3.25,2.5,"look: no head, few bubbles there initially but very quickly fades, no lacing, beer is murky amber colour, lots of sediment, not particularly attractive but not bad either.

smell: not much malt character, it’s grainy and biscuity i suppose, stale bread, really quite sweet, somewhat sugary sweet, honey, orange, hint of lemon zest, some grass, slight earthy flavour, doesn’t smell off putting nor does it smell overly inviting.

taste: i mean, doesn’t taste bad, but it doesn’t taste of much, some malt flavour there, definitely grainy and earthy, the sweetness is there but it’s not as potent as the nose, honey and orange, bit of bitterness on the finish, i mean it’s perfectly drinkable, not a lot to say about it though.

feel: light bodied, medium carbonation, crisp and refreshing, but also quite watery, really lacking in depth and variety of flavour.

Coopers Original Pale Ale,3.0,2.75,3.0,3.0,"L- Popped the cap then realised it's a screw-cap; haven't seen one of those in years. Rested for a day since purchase, still pours with moderate haze that should be neither too much for me, nor denying the beer it's potential. 3-4mm white head, receding slowly.
S- Not that distinct, I just get some mild grains from it.
T- Quite bright hops, bring a bitter note, some graininess, but overall there doesn't seem much to it.
F- Well carbonated in the mouth, a thin bitter hoppy edge but little can be distinguished from the rather bland body that follows.
O- It would be refreshing though it's quite uninteresting. There isn't anything I notice that makes me think 'I want to drink THIS beer again'. There isn't anything wrong as such, just there isn't anything at all special either.

I'm looking forward to having one down under (in the winter) on the beach. CheersJun 25, 2019"
Coopers Original Pale Ale,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Pours golden, hazy with sediment. There aren't many beers with sediment in it in America--the last time I saw one was Weyerbacher's Merry Monks--The look can be offputting and I'm not an exception to that, but it must be reviewed. 

It's easy on the nose, forward palate, doesn't linger. Very malty. Very smooth. It's kind of sweet, even. Usually in a pale ale, the hops are so overpowering that you don't think about the malt, or even that it's an ale. 

There's a good balance in this brew. It's a beer you can drink with your mates, Oi! Oi! Oi!

I appreciate that it brewed in 12.7oz bottles. It feels like every other brewery is trying to squeeze you into an 11.x bottle and that just ain't right. Then again, I heard something once, in passing, that in America, you get taxed more for 12oz+ beers.

Pours clear at first, but I stirred the sediment and let it roll in, now it's cloudy and some yeast chunks, light fizzy head with low retention, medium gold color, def should have more head and retention

Nose a little toasted bready grainy malt, little malty sweet, some fruity esters, light herbal earthy maybe floral hop, hint fruity hop notes too I think and a touch peppery-spice, fairly light

Taste starts with the malty sweet flavors, a little toasty grainy but mostly smooth pale malts, some fruity esters kick in, pear, maybe a little banana as well, then more apple late and quite a bit of it, medium hop flavor a little earthy herbal, faint sulfury note and maybe minerals, very dry and quick finish, bit of bitterness but not nearly as bitter as I expected (maybe age?)

Mouth is medium bodied but feels full rounded, with tingly prickly carbonation that tingles the tongue

Coopers Original Pale Ale,4.25,3.5,4.0,4.0,"The first pale ale that I drank seriously, 10 years or so ago when craft beers were starting to make an impression in Australia.

I am sure it is not as cloudy as it once was. So now a little lighter, but not fizzy. Appropriate. O. The pale ale that started it in Australia. First few times that I drank this, coming from a background of XXXX bitter since the 1980s, I found it hard going.

Coopers Original Pale Ale,3.75,4.0,4.25,4.0,"It pours golden with hardly any head despite the obvious high carbonation. The aroma is bready and with some malty sweetness. A surprising fruity presence. The taste is well balanced and fairly rich for a beer of this style. Medium body.Aug 14, 2017"
Coopers Original Pale Ale,2.75,3.25,2.0,2.0,"Appearance: Pours a cloudy orange. Decent head that fades entirely over a couple minutes with some lacing with medium size bubbles. 

Aroma: Suprisingly I get some Belgian yeast-like scents from this, along with the usual breadiness and hints of hay and lemon. 

Mouthfeel: Very very thin, more so than more AALs, even the lightest. Moderate medium size carbonation. 

Taste: After the rather nice scent I was unfortunately let down by the taste. It was extremely lacking in depth and did not linger on the palate at all. I'm hesitant to give specifics on the taste as there was very little. Much more like a light AAL rather than a pale ale. 

Overall: Maybe my hopes were too high after reading other ratings, but I was very let down by this beer. I do not think that it deserves the rating it gets on here at all. Though I'm open to giving their other varieties a shot, perhaps I just got a bad one.Jun 10, 2017"
Coopers Original Pale Ale,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,"A 375ml bottle with a BB of July 2018. Purchased quite recently from Morrisons. A classic Australian ale.

A: Poured into a tulip. Bottle conditioned. A golden hue with good carbonation and tons of floating sediment. Produces a smallish head of white foam that settles rapidly and disappears.

S: Aroma of earthy yeast with hints of pale malt, mild grain, faint grassy hops and a twinge of herbal spice. Subtle but balanced.

T: Tastes of dry, earthy yeast with notes of grain, light malt, faint grassiness and stewed hops. A delicate bitterness upon swallowing.

M: Smooth and spritzy, with good body and texture. Very dry; yeast coats the palate. Aftertaste of yeast, mild grain and stewed leaves.

O: A decent brew, though I can sympathise with those who consider it dull. Lacklustre looks, mainly due to the lack of head. The aroma and flavour are yeast dominated and subtle, while the body is nice. What this has in it's favour is drinkability - I could see this going down OK in the Australian heat. Anyway, worth trying as long as you don't expect to be blown away.May 23, 2017"

Hitachino Nest Red Rice Ale,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,"11 ounce bottle poured into regular kitchen pint.

Pours a dirty orange with half a finger of off-white head that leaves scattered blobs of lace as it quickly recedes.

Smells of grainy biscuit, juicy citrus, tart berries, banana chips, some sort of creamy sweetness that I'm going to guess is from the rice, some spicy yeast and floral hops.

Tastes of more spicy Belgian yeast up front, biscuity caramel malt, subdued orange and lime, nutty banana bread, more sweet creamy rice, dried berries and more flowery hops.

Feels a bit wimpy. Medium bodied with prickly carbonation. Finishes off-sweet.

Verdict: Recommended. Kind of all over the place, but in a pleasant way. Worth trying.Jul 27, 2021"

Hitachino Nest Red Rice Ale,4.5,3.5,3.25,3.25,"Hitcahino's Red Rice Ale is somewhat hazy and medium copper in color. The head is cloudy, off white in color, and decently lasting.
Takin a sniff, the first thing I notice is an aroma that is toasted and malty in the form of biscuits and sweet caramel. Underneath all this is something that is both vinous and earthy. Anything fruity I smell seems to be more red grape than anything. The finish is very gently spicy in nature, before fading from existence.
Red Rice Ale is a smooth, medium bodied ale. It's very malt forward, giving flavors of caramel and toasted bread. Generic fruitinesss coupled with flavors of yeast come through in the center. There's also a sort of bready, doughy flavor mixed in there somewhere. The finish is short and sweet.
It's a decent enough beer, the flavors are balanced well enough. Somehow the overall package just doesn't make me enthused about the beer overall.Mar 21, 2021"
Hitachino Nest Red Rice Ale,4.5,4.25,4.0,3.75,"-Look: Pours a very nice Orange-Red. Minimal head which recedes to just a bit of lacing. 

-Smell: Sake. Has a fruity mix of sweet and sour, the sour part is very subdued. It has a thick/ sweetish rice smell as well.

-Taste: Mostly rice. A very light sweet/sour taste but not as fruity as the smell. Alcohol is hidden well with a crisp-ish finish. 

-Feel: The finish does seem light but the mouthfeel trends towards a medium bodied beer in my opinion. 

Overall: An interesting and easily drinkable beer. The flavor is middling compared to some of Hitachino Nest's other offerings. Definitely a different Belgian Strong Ale.Feb 03, 2021"
Hitachino Nest Red Rice Ale,4.25,4.0,4.0,4.5,"This one pours a slightly hazy pinkish-reddish color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

Crisp aroma of grainy, pre-malted barley. A light touch of lemon zest. 

Mostly malty, unlike the smell. Some yeast zing, but not very Belgian. There’s some citrus zest to the tongue but not it’s closer to blood orange. The beer is thin bodied with ample carbonation. Short aftertaste.

Hitachino Nest Red Rice Ale,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.75,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass

Appearance – The beer pours a lightly hazed dirty orange color with a small head of white colored foam. The head fades rather fast leaving just a trace of lace on the sides of the glass.

Smell – The aroma of the brew is rather strong of a bready malt smell mixed with lots of caramel and a bit of herb. Along with these aromas comes a touch of dark fruit and a bit of heat from an alcohol smell. Overall it's rather bready and warming.

Taste – The taste begins with a sweet malty flavor with lots of lightly toasted bready and doughy tastes as well as a sweetness of orange. At the same time there is a moderately strong caramel flavor mixed with some dark fruit flavors as well as a little bit of a light apricot and peach taste. As the taste advances the breadiness and sweet remain strong, but are joined by some flavors of herb and earthy hop. Toward the end a touch of the booziness that was detected in the nose is felt on the tongue, and when mixed with the rest of the tastes, leaving one with a nice and robust warming taste to linger on the tongue.

Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is thick and chewy with a carbonation level that is medium. For the big breadiness, sweetness, and light alcohol hit of the brew the feel is good and makes for a nice sipper.

Overall – A very tasty and quite flavorful brew. Bold, but balanced!!Aug 27, 2020"
Hitachino Nest Red Rice Ale,3.5,4.0,3.75,3.75,"Decanted from an 12 oz (355 ml) can into a muffin top pint glass; no production information.
A: Pours a somewhat more than slightly hazy, rose color with no more than a finger of pale pink head formation, rim retention, and essentially no lacing. Production information would have helped in assessing the reasonableness of this.
S: Tart side of tangy. Subtie banana, cranberry, and clove aromas throughout.
T: More semisweet than semidry. Fruity with berry (raspberry, cranberry) superseding the banana or cloves. Does have a somewhat sake-like note that I have a hard time putting my fingers on. Very, very refreshing while chilled; less so when not. Bitterness light but sufficient to lead to crisp, clean finish.
M: Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Crisp and refreshing.
O: Really didn't know what to expect, so was pleasantly surprised, although it hardly drinks like a Belgian Strong Ale. that said, I would be hard pressed to classify it.Aug 04, 2020"

Odd one. Some interesting fruity notes, crisp + lagery, contrasting quirks more than real complexity, flavours clean up after themselves + not insignificantly boozy. 
Tough to know how to rate it because I don't know what it's trying to be. I'd love to know how much of this is just the rice, or if the yeast is doing some of the work.

Hitachino Nest Red Rice Ale,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Kind of a strange beer. Reminded me of a cross between a Belgian wheat, lighter sake and a lager. No date printed on bottle. Pours a somewhat rust-pink color with just a little fluffy white head and minimal spotty lingering lacing. Smells of some light Belgian wheat and yeast, no real banana or clove. Some grain, malt, faint hops, bread and caramel. Taste follows the nose, decently flavorful but a little too indistinct for me and it seemed to lack depth or character.

Hitachino Nest Red Rice Ale,4.0,3.25,3.5,3.75,"Picked this up because of the label art alone, glad I did as this was an okay experience...

Coloration is an orange-tinged, reddish colored brew, the foam is thin and short-lived. Smell is wheaty, which translates to the taste along with a distant sweet flavor that I surprisingly tasted. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, lightly carbonated, and has an almost spicy twitch to the tongue. Not a bad brew, not the best thing I've had but it was a nice surprise to experience.Nov 03, 2019"

Hitachino Nest Red Rice Ale,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"£3.95/330ml from Harvey Nichols dept store in London SW1 - let's hope it proves worth it!
L- I'm not sure about 'red', though it is to the orange-side of chestnut. Pours with very slight haze and 1Cm ultra-fine white head.
S- There's something of a woody/leather smell to this.
T- Balance comes first, then some power. The flavour is solid but clean. 0.00% out of line or objectionable. The lable suggests 'A hint of fruit in the nose and palate'; I don't get that, others might well, but I like it. There is no lingering after-taste on the palate, another positive.
F- It feels every bit of 7%. Carbonation is also good in the mouth (the head is holding very well too). You might not be reaching for this on a blazing August day in Kyoto, but elsewhere less madly balmy I could drink this year-round.
O- Lovely, intriguing, slightly different style but the Japanese search for perfection shines through. Still, hugely expensive, £12/litre, as much as I like it I'm not pursuaded it's THAT good to warrant paying such again.

The rice adjuncts are the dominant aroma throughout, its sweetness seemingly out of place for the style. Yeasty and with fruity esters, apples and beer. A faint alcohol spice makes a fleeting cameo.
The taste is dry at first, however, the rice adjuncts and wheat like malts soon bring a sweetness. Yeasty flavors that bring forth fruity esters, apple, pear, even a fleeting hint of orange peel. A light alcohol spice is present throughout. The finish is sweet, rice like, has a touch of alcohol, and slightly sticky and dry towards the end of the drink.
Medium bodied and with a lower carbonation than I’m accustomed to for the style.

Aromas of light caramel and sawdust, raisins, dates. Dried fruit with a touch of...something...that's interesting. Like dried wood.
Candy sweet, with loads of raisin, dates, brown sugar, a touch of butterscotch. There's a hint of something a touch burnt, fresh dried wood again, and toffee. Kind of like a wee heavy, though not as syrupy feeling. Medium carbonation and warming alcohol burn provide some balance to the sweetness, though it would still be tough to drink more than one of these.

The Belgian ale character is detectable, but has been dried out and soured somewhat by the shochu barreling. I've had sake many times, but not sure I've tried shochu, although the sake flavor is clear hear and must stay strong during distilling. Although this is interesting and there is some nice wood and a unique flavor from the barrel, I'm not sure the sake tartness fits my palette.

I'm getting sweet dark candied fruits in the taste, slight roasted malt, some black cherry, slight cocoa, some toffee, & slight coffee & earth spice to round out the finish. There is a little sour taste in this beer as well but nothing too off putting. The booze is well hidden for an %8 beer. This beer is reminiscent of Trappistes Rochefort 8 but it drinks smoother.

Aroma: Toffee, Malt, sweet rice, esters

Taste: Very much like the aroma, but amplified. Smooth toffee notes, an almost creaminess. Full and malty. The Hitachino Nest house yeast flavour is more pronounced (or perhaps just works exceptionally well in this format) than usual. Finishes with a warm aftertaste from the high ABV, otherwise difficult to notice it's 8%. Very, very nice.

Mouthfeel: Lighter than most Belgian Strong ales it's styled after. Silky, soft, medium/heavy body, low carbonation.

Hitachino Nest Extra High,4.25,4.0,4.0,3.75,"Pours a opaque burnished copper with a finger of khaki-caramel, oily head. Head foams up well, with moderate retention. Lacing doesn't linger very long after a swig of XH. Aroma has dark fruits, and Belgian yeast esters up front. Some sake and cask shows up a little later, giving it a slight burn on the finish. Flavor profile is smooth, with dark fruits, Belgian yeast esters, sake, oak, and clove working to form a fantastic twist on a Belgian Strong Dark ale flavor profile. Mouth feel is smooth, filling, with a medium-thin thickness. The thickness is lacking in the feel, but otherwise it's well-rounded. Overall, a great example of a unique twist on the Belgian Strong Dark ale. Having sat in casks for a while, the beer does loose a little in the look and feel, but is otherwise very well balanced.

Appearance: The body is opaque with a medium brown color mixed with a dark shade of orange. The head is a tobacco stained yellow color that is both short and short lived. Low head retention and no lacing.

Aroma: I'm not picking up much aroma at all. There is this light spicy hop character but no Belgian yeast character and no aroma from the sake casks mentioned on the label.

Taste: It has quite a bit of alcohol flavor but no burn or heat from the alcohol. Other than that all I get is a watered down malty flavor. No finish.

Mouthfeel: Light bodied without much texture, decent carbonation, no bitterness, and no discernible finish.

Overall: A lackluster beer that doesn't work well as a Belgian anything. Maturing the beer in sake casks didn't seem to add anything. It is a very watered down, mostly flavorless, beer. I wouldn't drink it again and I don't recommend it.Jun 26, 2016"

It opens light brown but if you aren't careful, a bunch of brown sludge will make its way into your glass - I got a little - making it deeper colored. The aroma is subdued for the style - barely any of the yeasty fruity overtones. The taste is somewhat dry and subdued too. It is easy drinking for the style. There is a bizarre woody character, obviously the cask aging.

This is an inventive brew, and unique, but I can't really recommend it. Maybe for half the price.Jun 09, 2016"

The nose is sweet with notes of caramel, cracker and biscuity malts. There is a touch of roasty malts that evoke chocolate. Aromas of fruit including orange and cherry, as well as floral and woodsy hops.

The taste turns out to be too sweet to my liking with too many flavors of butterscotch. The palate is somewhat dry but not enough. Flavors of cracker and biscuit malts, lightly creamy and with notes of caramel. Flavors of fruity, woodsy and floral hops and a developing bitterness that somehow feels unbalanced.

This certainly doesn't taste bad, but there's not a whole lot going on here. There's a bit of carame, not much, some toasted bread, and a bit of staleness. This one's best by 7/11/14- ha.

This is light bodied, with a bready and crisp mouthfeel, and a moderate level of carbonation. It is drinkable, at least.

S: A somewhat muted aroma of malt and light hops. Nothing special.

T: Tasted of roasted malt, a nutty quality that seemed to vanish somehow, and hops. As it is with these types of beer, the major problem is that they're very thin and watery. The flavor here is just that.

Efes Dark,3.75,3.0,3.25,3.5,"11.2oz bottle purchased at the Spokane Valley Total Wine for $1.99. My first Turkish beer. According to the label, this was best before “18/04/14.” Thanks for your attention to detail, TW.

Poured a dark, cola-ish color that took on a reddish hue when held up to light. A decent-sized head that was somewhere between beige and tan in color stuck around for a couple of minutes before receeding to a thin version of itself, leaving a decent amount of lace.

Roasty malts and grassy, slightly skunky hops in the aroma, in pretty much that order.

Primarily rosted malts in the flavor, with the grassy hops forming an accompaniment and then a slight aftertaste. Mostly clean finish. Tastes like a lager version of Newcastle Brown, but with slightly less flavor.

Slightly creamy yet thin mouthfeel.

An okay Euro dark lager. Not much to write home about, but not exactly offensive, either, though it could possibly be improved upon if fresher, I suppose. At least I’ve had another beer from an Islamic nation, which is something of a rarity.Jul 17, 2014"
Efes Dark,3.75,3.0,3.5,3.5,"Sampled at Cafe Istanbul in Dublin, OH (where else to drink a Turkish brew than in a town named Dublin, eh?).

Pours a dark yet opaque, alluding to a crisp taste. The little amount of foam that develops quickly disperses, leaving only a white foam ring around the perimeter.

The smell is mild, but has hints of malt.

The taste is surprising. Expecting a dull or bitter flavor, so the flavor of sweetness, malts, caramel and chocolate surprise and delight the senses. No one aspect stands above the rest. 
Carbonation helps keep the taste profile light and crisp. A very refreshing beer for an arid climate.

Efes Dark,3.5,3.25,3.0,3.25,"330ml Bottle as a gift brought back from Marmaris, Turkey:
Caramel brown with a 1cm, bubbly head that is light brown & settles as a patchy lacing.

Lots of malts & roasted notes plus faint hops & grain with caramel as well. Sugar & toffee makes an appearance too with some very faint fruits towards the end.

Roasted malts & some sweetness with some caramel & toffee from the nose. A little bit of spice comes through around the middle with hints of treacle as well.

Smooth & inoffensive with some bland patches & overall the beer seems a little thin. Some bitterness & touches of sweetness throughout as well. It's an easy enough beer to drink & carbonation is about light medium in my opinion.

Not a bad Turkish offering, to be honest this is just about as good as I've tried from the country with only the odd exception. Definitely drinkable and easy going; it's one worth picking up if you're in the country but probably not if you mange to find it elsewhere.Jun 02, 2014"

This is a tick ten years in the making. 

From a bottle into a pils glass
Best before 20 May 2014
6.1% ABV 

APPEARANCE: Pours a 1+ finger, medium looking, fluffy, off-white head with good retention. Slowly fades to a solid creamy cap and coats the sides of the glass. Clear burgundy or maroon brown in color with medium levels of carbonation. Full wisp remains and leaves lots of nice lacing down the glass. Good looking for sure. 

SMELL: Dark bread, light plumbs and raisins with some grainy notes, touches of honey and some floral hops as well. A little mild, but alright. 

TASTE: Dark bread again, touches of raisins and dark grapes, with some honey sweetness at the swallow. Milder flavors up front get better after the swallow, with a bolder and more lingering finish of dark fruit, dark, grainy bread, some honey sweetness, caramel sweetness and a nice dose of flora, hop bitterness as balance. 

PALATE: Medium body and carbonation. A touch watery on the palate, unfortunately, goes down fine and finishes crisp and dry. A touch of bitterness lingers. Not as nice as the regular pilsner. 

OVERALL: This Turkish whale definitely lives up the the (lack of) hype. A solid dark lager for sure. People will give it a rough time as this style is not as well appreciated as others, but it's definitely a good example of the style, and something I would have appreciated seeing more often, or at least 'at all,' while I was in Turkey.

Efes Dark,3.75,2.0,3.0,2.5,"Cross off another country from the list which I've tried a beer from. Efes Dark comes in a clear 330 ml bottle and has a twist-off top. On to the beer:

No false advertising, as this beer is dark colored. Cherrywood brown and topped with a thin head which has okay retention, but it leaves a checkerboard of dotted lace around the glass. Oooo, that has a stinky aroma. The base malt is pleasantly sweet, but is ruined by herbal skunked hops. 

With some luck, the taste is decent. It starts reasonably sweet like a dunkel lager and for a moment, I thought that it could climb higher. Those hops, agghh, they're not exactly in good form. It gives the beer a sulfur note, along with the added skunkiness. Adding to injury is the beer's slick feel in the mouth which sticks around.

Efes could have been on the verge of being a surprise if it were in prime condition. Clear glass is usually not a beer's friend, more so in the sunny climate of Turkey.Jan 18, 2014"

Efes Dark,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,"Reviewed from notes.

Pours out a dark brown with a minimal flash head that doesn't leave behind any lacing. Lighter side of medium body and carbonation levels.

Smells and tastes partially skunky, but there is some mild toasted bread in there in the background of the flavor and some mild floral hopping in the aroma. And that's it. A simple beer with not much going for it other than the very basics. Overall it's not very good, but not quite bad enough for me to call it terrible. It is, however, completely forgettable and most certainly not good enough to actually seek out.Oct 30, 2012"

Served chilled in an over sized wine glass. 
Best Before: 06/07/13

Thanks to my buddy Jon for bringing this back from Turkey for me. 

Appearance: Medium brown body (a back light shows it to in fact be deep red) topped by a large off white head. The head lasts pretty well and coats the glass in beautiful sheets of lacing as it recedes. 

Smell: This actually smells half decent. Notes include: Toasted grain, some caramel, a touch of chocolate and sweet maize. 

Taste: Nowhere near as good as the nose, with a lot more sweet adjunct character noted. Maize and stale grain are about it, with almost no dark malt character noted. 

Mouthfeel: Light body, with a high level of fairly smooth carbonation. 

Overall: Efes Dark is certainly drinkable and better than some other dark lagers I have had, but I think I prefer their standard pilsner.Oct 08, 2012"
Efes Dark,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.0,"A: The beer is clear but a very dark reddish brown in color. It poured with a quarter finger high off white head that died down very rapidly leaving some lacing on the surface and a thin collar around the edge of the glass.
S: There are light aromas of dark malts and sweetness in the nose.
T: Like the smell, the taste is slightly sweet and has flavors of dark malts with notes of burnt caramel and molasses. The latter two flavors particularly linger though the finish.
M: It feels light-bodied and a bit watery on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This beer is rather easy to drink and has a nice amount of flavors.Jul 21, 2012"
Widmer Brothers Pitch Black IPA,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.25,"A lighter shade of black. Mild viscosity. Aroma didn't give enough hops, gave more roasted qualities. 

Taste once again puts it in the average category, most black ipas simply come off like thinner, hoppier porters, merely schwarzbiers with ale yeast instead of lager. 

Plenty bitter. I dunno, not enough aroma, flavor, more than enough bitterness and roast.Feb 25, 2016"
Widmer Brothers Pitch Black IPA,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Had at the Bryant lake Bowl on tap. This pours bright black with a ½” off-white to tan foam collar. Citrusy, grassy hops in the aroma and taste. Not a lot of roast flavors, more dark malt, some unassertive chocolate and a lingering sweetness are met by a mild hop accent. Medium body and carbonation. Does not push any boundaries but is very smooth and drinkable.Aug 18, 2015"
Widmer Brothers Pitch Black IPA,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Appearance: A small, dense tan head with good retention crowns a deep-black body. The lacing is scattered and Belgian-style

Aroma: Dark roasted and charred malts are well-balanced against grassy and slight pine hops. Hints of caramel as present, as well. 

Taste: Opens with dark roasted and charred malt, with hints of caramel here and there, along with a strong presence of mostly citric hops. There is an interlude of nuttiness as well, perhaps of roasted walnuts? The hops, overall, manage to dominate the taste with grapefruit coming to the fore, though there are lesser grassy notes. Late in the taste, the dark roasted malt makes a late appearance. Finishes with lingering citric hop bitterness.

Mouth feel: Smooth and full, gracious and very pleasant.

Drinkability/notes: Despite the ""IPA"" designation, this comes across, and comes across well, as a generously-hopped dark ale. Very pleasant and drinkable, especially on a cool autumn day, albeit out of its natural late winter to early spring season.

Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass long-neck bottle, with a pop off crown. Served in a New Belgium Brewing chaliceApr 11, 2015"

M: Slightly too much fizz.

Widmer Brothers Pitch Black IPA,3.5,2.0,3.0,2.0,"This was a disappointing offering. First of all I love IPAs but I've only had a few black IPAs. Second, this wasn't a bad beer but it tasted more like a porter than an IPA. Smell was dark with a slight hop aroma. Taste was smokey (like a porter) and never tasted any hops. The aftertaste was the worst. It was slick, oily and tart.Dec 10, 2013"
Widmer Brothers Pitch Black IPA,4.0,3.75,3.5,3.0,"22oz bottle dated Jun 03 13. Served in pint glass. Beer pours actually more brown than black, though totally opaque in the glass, with a medium foamy chestnut head. Aroma is decent, but more big malt brew than IPA, like a brown ale or even a coffee stout. Flavor confirms it: roasty, nutty flavors, with a strong mocha flavor. Like an overly fizzy chocolate stout. Besides the fizziness it has the thinner mouthfeel of an IPA, too. But -- not to say that this brew is too sweet -- I really don't get any particular hop character. To call this an IPA is a sham. Beeradvocate calls it American Black Ale, but this is no CDA either. Still, it's decently enjoyable for what it is, even if it misses the style guidelines.Nov 02, 2013"
Widmer Brothers Pitch Black IPA,4.5,3.25,3.25,3.0,"I think the beer has a great ruby color when you hold it up to the light. As a result, it's not pitch black like it's name, but I think it looks great nonetheless. It's an okay beer otherwise. It's got a decent taste, with a bit of a piny smokiness to it. The brew is a bit thicker, and the carbonation gives it a bit of an edge. It did have nice lacing. It's a drinkable IPA, certainly. 

serving type : Bottle.Sep 25, 2013"
Widmer Brothers Pitch Black IPA,4.5,3.75,4.0,4.0,"Well, not quite pitch-black but fairly close. Some ruby highlights, and a tan head that's quite sizable and holds its own. Very nice lacing. Not too much on the nose - some malty pine, woodsy charcoal, a bit of grapefruit. For a black IPA it is very drinkable. More pine and citrus, some smokiness and malt. There's a bit of an oily feel, mild carbonation, heavier than I anticipated. Very reasonable price for a bomber at $4.99, and one I'd gladly get again if for anything to look at the great designs in the lacing: a cat, a whale, three cyclopes dancing arm-in-arm.Sep 10, 2013"

Widmer Brothers Pitch Black IPA,3.75,3.0,3.5,3.0,"Never been the biggest fan of Widmer, but I couldn't say no to the name; sounded like a new take on my favorite style, so I thought I'd give it a go. Certainly the darkest IPA I've seen in a long time, but not ""pitch black"" like you would expect of an Imperial Stout. Instead it was a thinner, very very dark red, more similar to a porter, with a thin white head. Aroma is fairly benign: mild hops, light pine and some cocoa. Smokey flavor up front, leaves some chocolate and coffee on the palate. There are definitely some hops there, but the malts take a much bigger part of the stage. Mouthfeel was crisp, watery compared to a stout or a porter, heavy carbonation. 

Interesting brew. Sort of joins the worlds of IPAs and Stouts/Porters. I don't really know if it was a bridge that needed to be built though. Usually when I drink an IPA I'm not in it for the maltyness, and when I drink a stout, I'm not there for hops. A good beer, but a good beer with no home.Mar 17, 2013"
Widmer Brothers Pitch Black IPA,4.25,2.5,3.75,4.0,"22 oz brown bomber with pry off cap poured in a miscellaneous large glass at our rental condo in Turtle Bay, North Shore, Oahu. Purchased at Whole Foods in the Kahala Mall, but cheaper at the Sunset Beach Foodland on the North Shore.

Pitch Black is a great name as it's absolutely opaque. Obsidian black with a big foamy brown head over 1 inch on the pour and a solid 1/16th that sticks around with gobs of lacing.

Aroma is pretty muted. Faint roasted malts and undiscernable hops. Maybe a little floral.

Flavour profile morphs throughout. Roasted malts at the start, floral and citrus hops in the middle and burnt malt and dark roast coffee in the finish. Not extremely complex, but just enough to keep it interesting without muddling things.

Full bodied and rich with mild carbonation and a long finish.

This is quickly becoming one of my favourite styles. Not the best example I've had, but a solid offering and a welcome surprise on a rock in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.Feb 05, 2013"
Widmer Brothers Pitch Black IPA,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.25,"Poured into an oversized wine glass. Color was a mostly opaque black with a thick 1 finger light brown head. A fair bit of cling on the sides. Aroma was a roasted grain, with a bit of brown sugar in the back. Bits of lactose alternated with a bitter smell. Flavor was roasted grain with a bit of burnt lactose. As time went on, the burnt got a bit stronger. Felt good in the mouth, coated very well without being overly sticky. Overall not bad, but nothing special.Feb 04, 2013"

Cola, licorice sweets, a roasty bite and then mild orange rind and pine sap hops.
Thin, crisp, a bit of cling. 

Alchemy hops are seemingly a blend of Warrior and Millenium. 

Watery and not hopped enough for a CDA. Plays almost like a hoppy schwarzbier. Heard Widmer was the best of the CBA; this is a disappointment.Jan 29, 2013"
Widmer Brothers Pitch Black IPA,4.25,3.5,3.75,3.25,"Pours black as the name suggests, some brown hints along the top and very edges; tan head settles to a thin layer, medium lacing down the glass. Aroma starts off sticky, heavy, and dank with heavy hop oils and resinous layers unfolding left and right. The taste follows right through, overtaken by a solid hop profile; dank, oily, resinous. Slightly peppery, very faint citrus flavors, wet grapefruit rinds. Overall the hops are mostly wet and spicy. The backbone of this beer is very malty and it does a nice job of toning down the hops. Slight roasted character in the background; leaves a bready aftertaste which is very reminiscent of dry rye bread. Medium body, medium-high carbonation, just a touch of stickiness on the palate.

Not a bad beer at all. Black IPA's always surprise me, even though I know what to expect. It's like that purple colored Ketchup. Tastes like ketchup, but it just looks weird. Nice hop profile and a good balance with the roasted malts. Definitely a better brew than I was expecting.Jan 01, 2013"

A: Mahogany color with red/orange hues. One finger of beige head settles a but, but retains at an eighth of an inch. Pencil thin ring of lacing.

S: Crusty brown bread, molasses, thin ribbon of caramel, dates, figs, and raisins. Lots of phenol action in the form of clove and black pepper. Whiff of alcohol. 

T: Crusty and bready. Nutty. Big brown molasses impression, and flavors reminiscent of spiced rum too. Bit of caramel and cola. Stewed fruits. Dates, figs, and even some plum and red fruit. Dry spicy, with tastes of black pepper, big clove, and all spice being pretty prominent. Spicy alcohol is quite apparent too, though not hot. Lots of cola and spice on the finish.

M: Big, rich feel. Sense of weight is immediately lifted by stiffly scrubbing carbonation. A slight sense of stickiness is similarly sandblasted away. Round and chewy. Warming alcohol. 

O: Quite good. A big and brawny dubbel with great dimension and complexity. Well worth seeking this one out if you’re jonesing for the style.May 25, 2020"

This is definitely a tiny bit watery, which is unfortunate. There's no booziness, which is nice, but I'd wish for a bit more rich maltiness here. There's light caramel, a definite fruitiness, and a good breadiness, but it all seems a little reticent to me.

Maredsous 8 Brune,4.5,4.25,4.0,3.75,"Poured from 33cl bottle. Darkish brown with a fluffy beige head that settles down to a thick lacing. Aroma is of burnt sugar, cherries and plums and fresh-baked bread. Quite sweet and malty, Warm aftertaste, but surprisingly low alcohol taste for the ABV. Medium-full body. Nice beer.Feb 04, 2017"
Maredsous 8 Brune,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,"Nice tan cream head that dissipated to a thin creamy surface. Mostly a darker brown with perhaps some copper highlights when held to light; carbonation present. Good head retention when shaken back and forth. Smelled of burnt brown sugar, nuts, some brown bread, figs, and cherries. The taste is somewhat similar to the nose, with some variations: burnt brown sugar, spiced bread, slight sweetness going in and a dry slight alcohol taste in the backend; the most dominant flavor throughout was cordial cherries; a medium bodied brew that was easy to drink; smooth. A nice holiday sipper! CheersJan 02, 2017"

Contract brewed for Kaufland grocery stores in Eastern Europe.

Appearance: Light yellow color, crystal clear. About one finger of off-white dense foam with decent retention. Left one ring, then small bits of lacing.

Smell: Very light floral and grassy notes, sweet malt.

Taste: Mildly bitter, can't place the type of hops. A hint of malt sweetness, but mostly hops.

Mouthfeel: Light bodied, with plenty of carbonation. The bitterness lingers in the aftertaste, which is dry.

Sapporo Premium Beer,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.0,"Pouring a light honey color, the transparent liquid generates a very ephemeral, short, off-white head. The scent is of slightly sweet though hard to detect, and the initial taste is almost like a cider with a bit of bitterness at the end. The astringency of the carbonation takes a bit of this away and leaves a slight tingling on lips and tongue. This would go well with something starchy, like the pasta I'm having or sushi.

Sapporo Premium Beer,4.5,2.5,2.5,2.75,"Sapporo is crystal clear and pale, even paler than ripe hay. Thin streams of carbonation support a fluffy, bone white head with fairly decent retention.
Sapporo in its own way, smells like a lager should, at least at first. Malt gives us the expected aroma of fresh baked biscuits and lightly toasted grain. Adjuncts are there, smelling more of rice than corn to my amateur senses. The finish is crisp and dry, also presenting the leafy, slightly floral scent of hops.
Taking my first sip, Sapporo is very light bodied and has an up front dryness to it. Malt flavors come through more in the form of lightly toasted grain, not so much biscuits or fresh baked bread. Dryness carries through the center, highlighting what tastes like rice adjuncts. The finish is smooth, rounded, with just a hint of floral hops before that flavors fade into nothing.
It's dry and crisp, has some refreshing qualities on the way down. The problem is the flavors just don't quite come together for me. There are those hints of adjunct for example. And the beer seems a little dryer than it should be, overall. The flavors are just that tiny bit out of balance. Otherwise, maybe a 6 out of 10 for Sapporo.Apr 05, 2021"
Sapporo Premium Beer,3.25,3.25,2.0,2.5,"Ohhhh, Sapporo. A beer that's usually viewed as either a novelty, or something simple to enjoy at a hibachi or sushi restaurant. I tend to fall in between the 2 opinions, as I've had quite a few drunken nights tossing these back without putting much thought into it. For what BA is calling an American lager, it's pretty good, though I question whether or not this is and adjunct lager. Oh well, let's sit down and properly review this

Pours a clear straw old with a finger of white head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

The nose is, well, mostly just grain, but there's some depth to it. I'm picking up on aromas of lemon zest, raw grain, doughy malt, corn, and light grassy hops. It's really not awful for what it is

Sadly, the taste doesn't even come close to the slight depth the aroma has, leading to a beer that's easy drinking, but sacrifices flavor. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting grassy hops and tangy lemon. The swallow brings notes of cereal grain, corn, and crackery malt

I think the drinkability is the main appeal of this one, and with all due respect, the drinkability isn't that incredible outside of the context of Japanese cuisine or already being drunk. Medium light body pairs with mild carbonation, resulting in a watery beer, the only appeal being that it goes down easy. Finishes between dry and sticky with no aftertaste

It was certainly interesting to actually sit down and review this beer to break it down. Despite my rather low rating, I won't stop drinking this in the usual situations. An interesting case in the beer worldMar 22, 2021"

Sapporo Premium Beer,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,"A sturdy steel colored 22 oz. can of it fills a clear glass liter mug nicely, with the help of a soft white head. This beer has a stronger and more appetizing aroma that most mass produced American lagers. This is probably due to the sole use of barley as the grain. This lager is quite ordinary in its color, a translucent light amber. The enduring head and subsequent glass lacing are better than most. The taste is more toward the dry side than its mainstream brethren. A clean and refreshing finish with a nod from some hops. A nice brew, but not good enough to convert an ale fanatic.Dec 30, 2020"

I mean ...Back in the day, when I was actually impressed when the logger setting on the stool next to me would crunch the can down into a pancake. 
After finishing the can I actually found myself holding the can in my hands thinking about crushing it ...and no, nobody would be impressed and I would undoubtedly be sorry for days as I recovered. 
Bottom line ...I enjoyed the moment, and I thought it was plainly and simply a good old can of beer! Nothing fancy, but nothing wrong with it either. Honestly all I really ask from a can of beer is that it makes me happy ...and I was delighted!

First impressions: clear and clean pour, nice foam. Light aroma. Touch of grain on the finish.

There very little bittering - but some hops is noticeable, mostly the taste is just a malty and crisp. I like that it's not watery like other Asian brews, this one has a decent 5.5% abv so that's always a plus. With all lagers you just have to ask yourself: is it better than a Bud?

Harbin Lager,3.0,2.0,2.5,3.0,"00ml can, 4.3% ABV, a not unsexy Oriental-lite presentation. Apparently imported by the Budweiser China Sales Company, from a different city than listed here. I'm too tired to actually look up or investigate that shit right now.

This beer pours a clear, pale straw colour, with two thinly foamy fingers of off-white head, which leaves a very low ebb of bubbly lace around the glass as it quickly fades from sight.

It smells of mineral water, a mild grainy corn grist, slight plastic essence, and little else. The taste is a fair bit sweeter, increasingly so in the same gulp, geez, of the sugary corn variety, natch, alongside a mild indistinct fruitiness, and thankfully very soft industrial metals.

The carbonation is more or less there, just there, the body a relatively meaty medium weight for the style, and generally smooth, nothing really egregious in the offset. It finishes on the sweet side, but hardly overly so, putting it a mile or so ahead of its average competitor, unfortunately with the tiniest of lingering, indicative plastic wrap twinges.

Probably the best lager, so, beer, that I've tried from China, and while it saddens me that it's from the AB/Inbev arm there, it also doesn't surprise me. This is pretty much Bud, since the usual runoff skank I get from this country's beers seems to be absent. So, considering the many degrees of degradation, um, good?Nov 20, 2012"
Harbin Lager,4.5,3.5,4.0,4.5,"I used to get this beer in a 22oz bottle from our local sushi joint and it was one of my favorite lagers. Unfortunately when that place closed I was forced to seek it out at our local suppliers for purchase and can now definitely understand the low reviews it is getting here on BA. All of the Harbin I can find to buy is in 12oz bottles only and tastes nothing like the larger ones I used to get at that restaurant. Maybe they got them imported directly from China in lead lined shipping containers to protect them? ;) 

The 22oz variety I used to get had a wonderful crystal gold shine to it and when poured would create about a one and a half inch micro foam head. The head provided nice lacing through almost the entire time there was still beer in the glass. There was a very clean and mildly astringent smell to this beer with just a hint of the Qindao Dahua hops and German lager yeast. The taste was very mild but crisp and refreshing, interestingly what you thought would be an impending aftertaste simply vanished before it could really develop. This beer had a big carbonation profile which lent nicely to the overall mouth feel/crisp note which made long draws very rewarding.

I will continue to seek out these larger(fresher?)Harbin's and hope that anyone aware of a direct supplier of them please let me know, as I really enjoyed this beer but refuse to drink the sub-standard 12oz variety that seems to be the only thing available at this point to me. So if you can find a source of the 22oz Harbin's, definitely chill one good and give it a try...goes great with sushi too :)Dec 08, 2011"
Harbin Lager,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,"Poured from a 11.2oz green bottle into a pint glass at low altitude.

A: Pours a wheat color a shade or two darker than a typical American adjunct lager with a fizzy white head -- little retention and no lacing worth mentioning.

S: Some malt and yeast notes mixed with a faint fruitiness and a some metallic notes. Not a very strong smell overall.

T: Malty notes up front followed by some surprisingly clean fruit notes. The metals from the nose thankfully didn't come through here. My only real complaint here is that it's almost entirely absent of any bitterness.

M: Light bodied with a good deal of carbonation -- very dry. The dryness was the feature that stood out to me most about this beer, but not necessarily in a good way.

D: The carbonation and extreme dryness of this beer make it a little hard to take down. I feel like I would need some water after a couple bottles of this.Aug 04, 2011"
Harbin Lager,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5,"I've had this while in China, but this was a present given to me from a trip made Aug '10....canned product, still fine! This is also direct from China, and the can states that this brew is greater than or equal to 3.6% alc/vol.

A- Love the logo and coloring on the canPours with a clear grassy color...very clear, and with lots of big bristly looking carbonation. The head is thick and super white in color initially but fades quickly into virtually nothing...just a half ring around the glass....nothing special here...just another standard looking Chinese lager.

S- Dry, very adjunct-ish...primarily of boiled corn water, dry graininess, and not much else. I suppose there is some sweet malt noticeable but it seems unnatural. No hop bitterness to be smelt for miles!

T- More of the same here....just lots of sweet corn adjunct goodness! This flavor lingers after the swallow as well. Mixed in here there is some mild malt sweetness as well but is overshadowed by the corn. Absolutely no hop bitterness available to the palate. 

M- Very thin, and with lots of palate scrubbing carbonation. These two characteristics keep this a crisp, relatively clean tasting brew, but there is the aforementioned aftertaste. There is also a bit of a cloying oiliness that gives this a real unique feel...watery yet oily....

O- Honestly, I remember this being better while on vacation, but then again, it was humid and warm. Again, like pretty much all other Chinese lagers, this one isn't anywhere near special, but for thirst quenching purposes, this hits the spot.

S: typical adjunct aroma. corn, barley, cereal like character. no hops noticible. I'm not surprised.

T: well...its definitely not an euro pale lager. slightly sweet grain/corn flavor. a bit of barley, faint hop flavor for balancing. finishes clean. I guess my expectations were very low. I'm surprised this doesn't taste awful.

M&D: ok mouthfeel; decent drinkability.

Beer Advocate desperately needs a ""Asian adjunct lager"" category. I think this beer wouldve got better ratings of they expected a euro pale lager.

This is a sad looking piss-yellow beer with no head. Corny and grainy. Not much else here. I'm struggling to find descriptors here. There is just a massive lack of flavor. Ok, I found some DMS, but isn't that unwanted in a beer? This isn't just a bland beer, it has a strange twang to it that I can't put my finger on. Regardless, I'm glad to have gotten rid of this last bottle from my fridge.Jun 09, 2010"
Harbin Lager,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,"Notes from 6-7-10 - poured into a personalized pilsner glass - 1 pint/ 4.3 fl. oz. (600ml) capped bottle

Appearance: Pours a dull, pale yellow with a nice white head. The head quickly dissipates to a thin ring. Lacing stays fairly close to the head. 

Smell: Aroma is very representative of the style. On the nose are grain, sweet malt, corn syrup, and some lager-type skunk. 

Taste: Syrupy malt sweetness with a very slight hop bite, with a dry finish. A hint of lemon is also present. This beer has no real aftertaste. 

Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation. Even though it can be thin and watery, the sweet malt is delivered well over the palate. 

Drinkability: This beer could be an easy-drinking session beer. However, it is a little too sweet for me. 

Comments: All in all, this is an enjoyable, albeit average beer with some decent attributes.Jun 08, 2010"
Harbin Lager,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,"Review from BeerAdvocate Magazine April 2007.

This brand is trying to come out of the gate during the Year of the Pig with a bang. Marketing is heavy on this beer, so we're guessing you should be drinking it at your local pan-Asian eatery soon. Brewed with both Chinese and European hops.

Snap, crackle and pop, the fizzy white lace dissipates into a thin ring around the glass. Perfect clarity under the dull, pale yellow color. Lemony hops with a ghost-like cooked veggie-and-cabbage aroma. Semi-crisp; has just enough carbonation to get by, with a slick, medium body. Cereal grain and malt flavor has a bite to it; clean snap of hop bitterness tries to clear the palate as everything goes dry. Very little aftertaste.

This is one of those ""When in Rome ..."" beers, meaning you'd be lucky to find a pan-Asian eatery that has a diverse beer selection, so this will suffice in the meantime. Perhaps one of the cleanest Chinese Lagers to date, and a sure pick when put up against the rest. Kung pao beef with a side of Singapore fried rice would be sizeable enough to tangle with this beer.Apr 07, 2010"
Harbin Lager,2.5,2.0,3.0,3.5,"You know, I don't mean to be 'harbin' on pale straw yellow beer and all, but this didn't start out lookin' so good. Aroma was even worse. I dunno, something not barley or hops.

Seemed to have some kind of zest equated with hops though and a slight enjoyable bitterness. I mean, it grows on you, what looked doubtful, made a return back to acceptable and beyond. I dunno what they used as a barley malt substitute, but its very light. Its a light beer, but its pretty enjoyable, don't think its corn, not that kind of sweetness.Apr 03, 2010"
Harbin Lager,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,"Compared to other beers in China its one of the better ones, but still quite poor compared to beers from the rest of the world. Taste is very inconsistent, usually its fine, a basic light larger. I have found on many occasions that its can have a stale taste. In that case its time to switch to something else because the whole batch is bad, and every Harbin in the bar will taste the same. Other times It seems overly hopped for the style, which is a pleasant surprise due to the fact that chinese beers hardly have any hop flavor at all. Also I found a fly in one of mine, so drink with caution.Apr 03, 2010"
Harbin Lager,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,"Harbin Lager was a brilliantly clear yellow with a modest white head that rapidly faded to a collar. 

The aroma was skunk, initially but that quickly faded and a lagerish malt/grain smell replaced it. 

The taste was malty sweet; good, but not head and shoulders above a long line of euro lagers. Just a slight bitter hops after taste. 

The mouth feel was light bodied with sufficient carbonation. 

Drinkability was good for this reasonably priced, lower ABV beer. 

Harbin was a good lager, nothing exceptional, but solid.Feb 15, 2010"
Harbin Lager,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,"Clear golden with a moderate cap of white foam that depletes itself over a minute or two.
Dry maltiness, likely adjucted with rice, with a twinge of green-bottled light-induced skunk, vague green grape notes, and a minor grassy/floral hop bite.
Crispy dry as it hits the mouth. Soup crackers and rice cakes. A minor grapeyness arrises midway, along with some mineral water bitterness. Hops continue along the dry motif, and add touches of hay and dried flowers at the end. 
Light bodied and well carbonation, but short of vapid and fizzy. This has a bit of character to it, albeit subtle. Its biggest asset is its thirst quenching ability. It's better than quite a few true ""Euro"" lagers out there. Better than expected, but still about mediocre.Nov 11, 2009"
Harbin Lager,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,"1.2 Ounce green bottle poured into a mug

Appearance: Golden yellow color with a quickly diminishing white head

Smell: It has a corn/rice smell to it, very similar to what I would expect from some of the macro Mexican beers

Taste: A little bitterness at first that leads into a slight sweetness. There are no strong flavors either way but they are fairly balanced to make a good, not great, taste.Oct 21, 2009"
Whistler Powder Mountain Lager,3.0,3.0,3.25,3.0,"Slightly hazy golden yellow. Moderate head to a ring. Apple nose. Plenty malt, also quite hoppy, fruity finish. Slightly doughy. Ordinary stuff, but drinkable.Dec 10, 2016"
Whistler Powder Mountain Lager,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,"30 mL bottle from a mixed 12-pack, picked up at TBS. Served well-chilled and reviewed on my phone.

Pours a somewhat hazy golden-yellow colour, topped with an inch of soapy, bone white-coloured froth. A bubbly collar of foam is the only remnant after a minute or two. Grain husks and gritty, doughy whole grain bread on the nose, with hints of grassy hay and lemon. 

Nothing to get too excited about here. The backbone is pure grainy pale malts; gritty, crackery and doughy, with light honey biscuit sweetness. Hints of red apple at the midpoint, followed by some spicy, grassy hops accented by suggestions of citrus zest and floral undertones. Off-dry finish with a bit of lingering doughy malt. Light-bodied, with fairly assertive carbonation that feels crisp and lively on the palate. Excellent drinkability, but overall it's a little on the dull side.

Final Grade: 3.4, a B-. Whistler's Powder Mountain Lager isn't bad, but it's not exactly all that memorable, either. A pretty typical Canadian craft pale lager - malt-driven, though with a respectable amount of hop scaffolding to keep things balanced - it's fine to drink, but not much more than that. I wouldn't turn one down.Nov 07, 2016"
Whistler Powder Mountain Lager,3.0,2.75,2.75,1.75,"Light straw in colour, thick white head. Slight citrus and malt on the nose. Hopped to the point of pilsner level flavour which leaves a bitter aftertaste that I don't expect from a lagerJan 15, 2016"
Whistler Powder Mountain Lager,3.25,2.75,3.5,3.0,"Nose is a little soapy and thin head soon fades. First taste revealed little but afterwards there was a pleasant fruity hop presence and a prominent biscuity malt character. Drinkable but unremarkable.Oct 24, 2015"
Whistler Powder Mountain Lager,3.0,3.0,3.25,3.0,"A decent lager. If lagers are your ""thing"", you might be pleasantly surprised by Powder Mountain. I sampled this as part of a mixer pack of cans, but I didn't leave this one until last. It is definitely better than your standard adjunct, with more substantial malt and crackery/pepper notes.Aug 08, 2015"
Whistler Powder Mountain Lager,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,"Served in a chilled pint glass.

Appearance: bright, translucent. Great lacing

Smell: sweet. Fresh cut straw, early spring rain

Taste: if a lager met a cider is the beat way to fit it. This strikes as more of a summer beer with lighter notes and crispness. Under ripe apple without the sour is the predominant flavor with a light amount of straw, matching the smell. 

Mouthfeel: medium, medium- carbonation. Definitely lingers in flavor

Overall: this is a session lager for sure. While the flavor isn't overwhelming, you're not left lacking either. Great beer for a group setting, easy on the palate with just enough to have you ask, ""what is this?""Jan 09, 2014"
Whistler Powder Mountain Lager,3.5,3.25,2.5,2.25,"I bought this at a BC Signature Liquor store which is known for it's wide varieties of wines and beers. This was on sale for $10 for a six pack — which is pretty good considering that Budweiser, believe it or not, is actually more expensive. For a craft brew, not bad!

The name ""Powder Mountain"" is actually an allusion to where the brewery is located: Whistler Mtn, which was one of the sites of the 2010 Winter Olympics. 

Labelling has a howling wolf. The font is old-timey, and makes the buyer feel he is buying a premium beer. 

So does the brew live up to it's own hype? Not really.

First, let me speak about what it does well. Powder Mountain Lager pours with a bright yellow colour with a sunny sudsiness. The smell is breezy and light. I wouldn't call it flowery, but it promises a gentle sweetness.

It's then when you taste it that the story changes. You see, Powder Mountain Lager seems to have an identity problem. It wants to be an easy-going sweet-tasting beer, but then the hops pop up and immediately force your attention. This beer doesn't know whether it wants to be sweet or bitter.

This is echoed in the mouthfeel where Powder Mountain Lager feels simultaneously thin and thick. The label itself states ""it's crisp as a moonlit night"" but I wouldn't echo this. Power Mountain Lager gives you a lot to think about.

Which brings me to the aftertaste. It stays with you a long time. After a few swigs, I decided to taste this with a deep pan pizza, and I can tell you that Power Mountain Lager overrules anything else you might be having with it. So if you're planning to eat anything with this, I suggest don't.

Powder Mountain Lager has good ideas. Unfortunately, it doesn't have anything to tie it all together.Jul 07, 2013"
Whistler Powder Mountain Lager,3.0,3.25,3.25,3.25,"Oh, it's alright. I guess I'm pleased that they went all malt and there is a hop presence here, but I wouldn't buy it in flats if that's what you're looking for. Poured it into a pint glass and it was straw yellow and fizzy as can be. I detect a hint of cereal grain, some grassy hops and some sweetness. It's rather bland on the palate, would probably be good with some nachos and a pepperoni and mush pizza. Not really something a guy like me reaches for, but respect the brewer for doing their thing in beautiful Whistler.Jan 11, 2013"
Whistler Powder Mountain Lager,4.0,3.5,3.0,2.0,"Bought this on the recommendation of some guy in the liquor store in northern BC (came to ~$1.86 per bottle). It pours with lots of white head and a slightly hazy, yellow or gold-yellow colour. There is a very light honey lemon aroma. The taste is also very light; I detect a little bit of spicy pepper, mustiness, and a taste I generally associate with adjunct lagers. There is also a light mouthfeel but very high carbonation. Overall,it's disappointing; too much carbonation makes it difficult to drink and very little taste which is easily lost if paired with food (or if you have recently ate or drank anything else). For a pale lager better to just go with the common Moosehead lager.Apr 16, 2012"
Whistler Powder Mountain Lager,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"30ml bottle. Uninformative descriptive wankery on the back label, concerning wolves or something.

This beer pours a clear, medium golden amber colour, with two fat fingers of puffy, loosely foamy, and mostly fizzy dirty white head, which leaves just a bit of sparse microbial lace around the glass as it quickly beats it outta Dodge. 

It smells of semi-sweet bready, slightly doughy pale malt, soft muddled drupe fruit, some earthy undertones, and musky, floral hops. The taste is lightly toasted bready pale malt, a touch of honeyed caramel, and bristling floral, musty, and somewhat straw-like hops. 

The carbonation is a bit peppy up front, but gently frothy overall, the body medium-light in weight, and a tad clingy, but generally smooth. It finishes off-dry, and mostly grainy, as the hops, while not deciding on any particular direction, do well enough to bond in their successful effort of providing adequate balance.

None too shabby a lager, with agreeable, if not really eye-opening flavour, and a distinct lack of the off-variety sort. One is inclined to wonder if this is just a re-branding of their regular 'premium' lager, but I'd have to test them in a side by side showdown in order to render a definitive comparison. I'm not holding my breath on that one.Dec 16, 2011"
Whistler Powder Mountain Lager,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,"Not a bad beer, this is. I'm not a mega lager fan - traditionally the style doesn't really impress me so when it comes to a lager I want something with that good standard ""beer"" taste that doesn't smell poor and has a good aftertaste so you don't feel disgusted with what you just had.

Whistler Powder Mountain Lager is better than most of the mainstream lagers I've tried, definitely. It's crisp, clean, has some good bite right off the bat, but a clean finish with minimal aftertaste. So in a way, it personified Whistler...so fresh, so clean, so crisp. The bottle itself is rather nice too.

Generally I've found the selections from Whistler Brewing to be solid (if not a wee bit expensive) so give it a shot if you like. I inherited a pair of these in the BC Craft Brews pack last month, and it's not bad. Just not anything to write home about and do backflips for.Dec 06, 2011"

Aroma has nuttiness from the hemp, really inviting, very organic and herbal.

Very bitter with an overall crispness. Quite refreshing. Could easy drink lots of this.

The label used in Christiania shows a yellow diamond with a hemp leaf and the word ""Turn."" 

Best before date was 08/05/2012. I had it in July 2011. Reviewed live. 

A: Pours a three finger head of soft foam, slight cream, and fair thickness. Retention is good. Colour is a cloudy dark yellow. 

Sm: Cream, barley, and light cannabis. Not hemp in the rope or seed sense, but more fresh. A moderate strength aroma. 

T: Hemp seed, honey, cream, and full barley. Very pleasant and refreshing. The hemp taste is very restrained - probably more a marketing ploy than a serious flavour consideration. It's complex for the style, and well built and balanced. 

Mf: Adorably smooth and wet. Amazing, actually. I didn't expect this level of fullness and refreshment from a seemingly gimmicky beer. I'm blown away. Perfectly complements the light pleasant flavours of the body. 

Dr: The flavours are a bit muted, but the mouthfeel alone makes her one worth trying. A very refreshing beer meant for a summer's day.Dec 26, 2011"
Cannabia,2.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,"Appearance: The beer pours a cloudy straw color with a foamy one finger head.

Smell: A sweet malt aroma is noticeable at first. A slight hemp smell becomes stronger as the beer warms; very interesting. 

Taste: A watery yeast taste found in many Euro lagers is apparent at first but there are no floral hints as found in many good pilsners. The aftertaste has a touch of spice from the hops and there is an ""earthy"" finish I can't put my finger on, maybe from the hemp seeds?

Mouth feel: Very light and easy to drink. There really is not much to note.

Overall: The hemp seeds provide an interesting aroma and aftertaste but the beer lacks complexity. I'm glad I had it but the experience was not spectacular. It was nice to have something different. By the way, the site claims the beer is retired but I was able to find quite a few bottles in Tokyo, of all places.Nov 28, 2011"

This smells like lemony hops, grain, pear, and citrus.

As a pilsner goes, this doesn't really fit into that box. it's still pretty tasty, though, and is a good use of sorachi ace hops - giving that sort of lemon and spice character you expect out of them. There's some sweet graininess, maybe a bit too much, but at least the hop character is nice.

This is crisp, mostly clean, and very drinkable, with a nice smooth finish.

Man, do I hate Sorachi Ace. 
That oily, pungent, herbal, over-lemoned character - almost like eating the skin off a piece of baked fish - is on display here, though not even the worst I’ve had. 
But that’s not even what’s wrong with this beer. By going up to 6.5%, it’s too malty which, combined with some low carbonation, makes it sit sweet and heavy. 
I’ve had the 8% version of Nipponia + not rated it so I was predisposed not to like this beer. And that’s why I won’t slam it too hard.

Hitachino Nest Nipponia,3.75,3.75,4.75,4.5,"L- Deep amber, poured carefully after a week's rest but some fine particles of sediment have come with the pour. Begins with 1cm white head that is holding pretty well. (Later reduces to a wide ring)
S- Quite puddingy with stewed fruits, not quite as prominent as I might have expected from an 8.0%ABV.
T- Wow, and 5 seconds later another (genuine) wow as it builds. Deeply alcoholic on the tongue, as if this has been liberally doused with a fine malt whisky. Deep stewed fruit flavours (think plums, deep and rich), with a notable alcohol tang that balances it.
F- Intense, puddingy, deep, rich but intriguingly balanced by the heft of 8.0%. This is a great beer. The closest comparison I could make vs an EU beer is vs say a monastic tripel or even quadrupel from Belgium.
O- I've tried several Hitachino Nest beers and haven't had one I didn't like. A good job as they tend to be $$$ to buy in the UK. This one is seriously-$, a shame as I'd very happily drink it again, more often if it were somewhat less so.
The Japanese are masters of borrowing ideas from others, and then improving upon them and exporting them (computers, the Walkman, rotary car engines, etc/etc/etc). Now we have the pleasure of the Japanese moving beyond major factory brews (Kirin, Asahi, Sapporo etc) and into more characterful beers such as this one.
Bought From Wholefoods, London W8 £7.49/550ml bottle. BB 08/19. A lot of money, but then I splashed out on something special for my 400th rating, and am thrilled that I did and chose this one.
Trivia: the bottle is notably solid, I weighed it, 430 Grams!
p.s. Others below refer to it as being a pilsener, or labelled thus; but I see no reference to this at all, and it definitely isn't anything like a pilsener in style. The lable reads: 'Hitahchino Nest beer, Ancient Nippionia'. No reference to any 'Style' at all. In fact I suspect the style 'American Imperial Pilsener' is not the correct one.Mar 19, 2019"
Hitachino Nest Nipponia,4.25,4.5,5.0,5.0,"I know Kiuchi brewery from JP, and remember them for their awesome - and not so common style - brews. This one has always been a kind of a mystery for me, what this could be like, until I finally managed to buy it.
And right after popping the bittle open I knew I made no mistake. Looks amazingly rich golden amber. Smells like - what? Grains, crops, beans? But the taste knocked me out. Amazingly complex, don't know where to start taking it apart. This rich barley grain taste is really intensive, then behind this wall you find normal malts, slightly sweet but the forefront just makes it really different. Bready, toasty, like japanese genmai brown rice? I love it. I feel hints of hops somewhere, but now that I'm trying to catch them they slip away and let the grains thump you into the ground. The ancient Kaneko Golden barley and Sorachi Ace combo - this is a true rarity indeed. And perhaps that's the most appropriate word for it - you definitely feel that you're drinking a rarity, like a vintage wine. Amazing. It is like going to eat japanese at a ryokan or where they serve you food from the best ingredients, this is it. For those who have been or lived in Japan, this will be more than just a phenomenal brew.

Taste: Strong lemon flavor - definite Soriachi Ace which I've had and is quite notable to me with its strong lemon flavor. Biscuity malt in the middle, and a lingering lemon, leafy herbal finish. There is also some orange citrus flavor in with all of this. Very tasty beer. 

Mouthfeel: Good carbonation, nicely thick, sticky on the teeth. 

Drinkability: This is a very good beer. I could easily have had another bottle of this if it was available. I had it by itself, but I think this beer would pair quite well with a wide range of food. It's an expensive beer, but I'll have to see if I can find this one again.Dec 19, 2016"
Hitachino Nest Nipponia,3.75,4.0,4.0,4.0,"0ml bottle poured into a pils glass.

Slightly hazy in a texture with golden color as a showcase, thick frothy white head builds up with good retention before gradually sinking to thin foamy sheet covering the surface and leaving nice lacing, high visible carbonation.

In a nose, you got juicy, citrus, pear, grassy, grain, spicy, malt as a bready profile, and a hint of yeasty ester.

Intense flavors led by zesty citrus, fruitiness is reminiscent of Belgian’s yeast estery while same time malt taken over with some sweetness and breadiness. Moderate bitterness from hop is at the end where same time it also reveals a herbal, spicy, and peppery notes covering the palate.

The body is medium with nicely smooth mouthfeel and lively carbonation through the palate, crisp and refreshing feeling, dry finish. 

Not as simple like typical pils but more complexity with good yeast profile and good brewing quality.Jun 18, 2016"
Hitachino Nest Nipponia,3.75,4.0,4.0,4.0,"this beer is bomb, a really drinkable brew, sort of an ale and lager hybrid, pale but somewhat more dense looking than others. i wish i could taste this special barley a little more than i can, it tastes like really fresh pale two row base malt, maybe a little starchiness to it, but im not necessarily tasting a new grain, unlike some of their other exotic grain beers that are more distinctive. the hops though are awesome, my favorite strain, and this is a cool expression of them. always seems to be ipa or saison with the sorachi ace, but here in this blonde beer, they really stand out in a new way, without bitterness from hops or sweetness from grain. uninhibited sorachi ace hops is a wonderful thing if you have never experienced it, and this is about as good as i have seen that done. fuller bodied than anticipated, maybe a product of the special grain. carbonation is on point, and its nice and dry. the sorachi puts lemon oil notes into this, lemongrass, mild tang, refreshing and awesome. these guys make some incredibly interesting beers. i wanted more from the unique japanese barley, but i like the beer as a whole an awful lot.May 17, 2016"
Hitachino Nest Nipponia,4.75,4.0,4.0,4.5,"Found this in a tiny Japanese supermarket in Queens and drank it two days after buying. Poured from 330ml bottle into 16oz pint glass. Beer poured a cloudy amber. Three fingers of lively foam subsided while I was trying to find the review button on this website, leaving behind substantial lacing.

Nose is flowery with prominent but not overpowering hops and hints of dill. No alcohol smell. 

Taste follows nose - hoppiness is gentle and grapefruity, very enjoyable for someone who is usually not a huge hops guy. 

Mouthfeel is crisp - the beer is refreshing and fairly light.

Overall, a fine beer for people in the middle of the hoppiness spectrum. Brick-in-face IPA enthusiasts will be disappointed, as will malt lovers. There's nothing double or imperial about it - it's a regular pilsner, just like the bottle says.Apr 16, 2016"
Hitachino Nest Nipponia,3.5,3.75,4.0,3.75,"Smells of hearty bread, sweet modified malt, and flowery, peachy hops. Appears a cloudy, deep amber with a pale, cream-hued head. The flavor has a solid foundation of hearty grains and considerably bitter, somewhat peachy hops. Feels creamy and full-bodied with just a little fizz. 

This is one of the more unique-tasting beers I've had. Seems like the barley does most of the work, giving it a firm, hearty aroma and flavor, while the hops line the malt with plenty of bitter, peachy flavor. The 8.0% alcohol hides well in the bitterness and grainy flavor.Sep 12, 2015"
Hitachino Nest Nipponia,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,"There is nothing to indicate (on the bottle) that this is a double or imperial pilsner. The label merely states ""Pilsner"". Mayhaps the Bros have more info on this than the bottle presents.

Pours a bright golden color with a full inch of foamy white head atop. Head drops fairly quickly, receding to a scattered clumping of thin, bubbly foam. Some intermittent lacing remains.
Smell is fairly typical of pilsners, saltines, some hops (peppery & citrus), a bit of malt. Balance is pretty good.
Taste is a step up from most of the others of this style I've had, although it is my least favorite style, by far. Notes of peppery hops, light citrus, crackers, dirt & grass. Solidly balanced.
A little more than medium on the body. Effervescence is not as pronounced as with others of the style, a good thing in my book. Dry finish. If you're gonna drink a pilsner, this would be a good one to reach for.Jul 09, 2015"

Hitachino Nest Nipponia,3.5,3.25,3.0,4.0,"Bottled 5/2014.

Pours a hazy honey orange with a foamy bone head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, candied citrus fruit, and slight cardboard aromas. Taste is much the same with grain, citrus fruit, honey, and slight cardboard flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

While the beer is light bodied and finishes crisp, the hops are subtle and this beer actually gives off some candy like sweetness and the balance between citric, earthy hops and this somewhat sugary sweetness is great.

Hitachino Nest Nipponia,3.5,3.75,3.75,4.25,"(purchased at Binny's Beverage, Marcey, CHI - bottle code NI.13.10 - poured into a balloon)

A: fairly clear, orange gold in color... good inch of frothy foam on the pour, falls quick, leaving a thin cap and island of medium-sized bubbles

S: (by now) classic Hitachino fruity yeast profile... not much in the way out front of quintessential Sorachi Ace aromas, maybe a faint trace in the back... fresh 8.5""x11"" printer paper... juicy pineapple, orange/lemon zest

T: quite faded Sorachi on the edges... mild spicy bitterness, faint peppery notes in the back... mellow attack of flavors but, nevertheless, vibrant essences of citrus peel... not getting much discernible malt flavor or sweetness - any sweetness, and there's not a ton, seems to be hop/yeast derived - this is fairly dry (and old)

M: smooth and slightly rounded up top, kind of flat with light friction across the tongue on the bottom... what I've come to expect from an age-ed HN

O: other than marketing, I don't understand why you would feature an indigenous malt and hide its potential unique nuances with such distinct yeast characteristics and Sorachi Ace hops on top of that - this ends up tasting like the lot of their light-colored beers (not that that's a bad thing!)... drinking yet another one of these just convinces me that I have to trade for fresher West Coast bottles or visit this placeJul 28, 2014"
Hitachino Nest Nipponia,2.5,3.75,4.0,4.25,"oz bottle into a pint glass.

Pours a clear dark gold but just a tiny bit of lacing and not really any head at all.

The Sorachi Ace hops are quite powerful in the aroma and there is also a slight earthy/oaky character. I'm assuming this is from the hops as well. Pretty intersting.

The flavor has a lot more complexity than I was expecting. That same dank/citrus hop note along with a stronger note of oak and vanilla; almost like this was wood aged. Not clean at all like a pilsner but more like an aged ale. Moderate bitterness and a pretty clean finish.

Overall, this is a very intersting beer. The wood/vanilla notes are unique and I love Sorachi Ace hops. A different, but well put together beer.Apr 11, 2014"
Hitachino Nest Nipponia,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bottle marked NI.13.03 at 44 degrees into pilsner glass
Aroma of a weiss/hefeweizen; phenolic, slight coriander
Head large (5 cm), white, creamy, mostly quickly diminishing into 3 mm layer
Lacing good – partial ring of small bubbles
Body medium yellow, hazy
Flavor begins like a weak slightly sweet weiss with more citrus than coriander flavor; no malt, no alcohol, no diacetyl, no hop bitterness found. Flavor ends quickly with no aftertaste.
Palate light to medium, watery, soft carbonation

An odd take on a pilsner – not clean and crisp but a more complicated flavor, probably from the Sorachi Ace hops. To me, this has more characteristics of a hefeweizen/weissbier than a pilsner. Not a bad beer, but not what I was expecting from a pilsner.Mar 26, 2014"

Satan Red,3.5,4.75,3.5,3.0,"Deep red colour, head dies down quite fast...

I really like the aroma...it's deep and complex and menacing. Many many elements...

When I had this in London a few years ago, it stood out as the best beer in the Belgian beer cafe I was in. I had had a few though before I tried it...

It's definitely complex, though it's missing the togetherness of flavors to make it really good. It's a bit too carbon dioxidey, and it's missing the fullness of a Duvel or IPA or alternative Belgian beer. If you leave it to rest for a while, it kind of improves.

The alcohol and hop bitterness fade in the finish giving way to some lingering malty sweetness. Medium body with crisp, lively carbonation. 

Picked up at an import store in Japan. I was surprised at how malty this one was, given the style. Nevertheless, very drinkable—crisp and flavorful with a restrained alcohol presence.Aug 10, 2014"

A: A bit less than a finger of head. Ranges from a mid-light burnt orange to peach (top-down) in the glass. Dimple is a dull yellow. A little arc of lacing.

S: Sourness is a little mild, reminding me of peach. I also smell peach skin/fuzz, oddly enough. A little tart cherry. A touch of golden apple.

T/MF: Practically no acidity in the mouth. Tastes more like a peach wheat beer, actually. Has some effervescent tingle on the tongue, and a bit of earthy funk. Not bad, but very disappointing for a ""sour"".

Poured into a Duvel tulip glass.

A - Pours a deep dark burnt sienna orange with hues of brown. Cloudy, but no real sediment is visible. About two to three fingers of fluffy off-white head.

S - The smell is kind of light and subdued, but it hits it's mark for me. Some twiggyness, overripe green apples, mustiness, earthiness, some caramel malt, some creaminess. It's a very pleasant aroma.

T - Taste follows the nose - earthy leafy hop presence, caramel malt, twiggy, herbal, candied apple, fig, raisin, lightly grapey, and some earthy yeast presence.

M - Feel is crisp, creamy, clean, and dry on the finish. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Some dark fruits and caramel malt lingering on the finish.

Overall, a delicious Belgian style ale, one of the better ones I have had in recent memory. More malt forward than many of the others I've tried, but it's still very nice. I would definitely be interested in trying this again. Recommended.

As the name suggests, this has a red hue to it's body colour, although it really has an orange amber beer. The head didn't hang around, it was beige when it was there.

Sweet fruits rule the nose and taste, mild apple feel with plenty of fizz in the body. Too pop like for me to be honest. I had this years ago and don't remember it being so heavily carbonated.

MF: Firm carbonation, medium bodied. Over carbonated for the style

First thing I noted was the carbonation, which fizzled down to the last drop. Not bad to see this in the style though, as it results into a lighter body.

Not much to smell, and only a hint of malt (I was assuming by that the ""Red"" in Satan Red was an indication of an amber, but I was mistaken). 

Overall, I would drink again as a stronger session beer as it goes down fairly easy, although you'll probably regret it after a bit at 8.0% (might be better to opt for something with a little more character).Sep 02, 2013"

33cl into a tulip. Pours a nearly transparent copper amber, minor white head, minor lacing.

Shares an over-ripe undefined sweetness, the kind found in apple cider minus the tart. Fruits that don't exist.

The flavor forsakes the level of sweetness and equals the meld of a dubbel and bsda, equal measures of both, equally respectful in both. A minor level of bitter in the finish, won't interfere with most foods. Medium smooth creamy mouthfeel.
no disrespect intended 
but this does not finish with a hint of zinc 
which most do when they smell like this

A: Pour is clear copper with small bubbles and a little light off-white head. No dissipations. Doesn't look as good as the Gold. 

S: Malt and some faint yeast and spices, Semi-sweet malt, slightly roasted. Fruity; ripe red apples and pears. Smell is a bit more modest than in the gold one. 

T: Rich Belgian yeast, some spices and lots of sweetness from the slightly roasted malt. Dark dried fruits, ripe bananas and red apples, even some red forest berries. Rich in taste. Sweeter and smoother than the gold. 

M: Full smooth body, low carbonation. Aftertaste is drier and more acidic than the taste, but not very long.

Satan Red,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,"0ml bottle, with appropriate Beelzebub beer-drinking imagery on the label. Thanks to the local rep for the sample.

This beer pours a clear medium golden amber colour, with two fingers of thinly foamy off-white head, which leaves some sparse islet lace around the glass as it readily abates.

It smells of semi-sweet pale grainy malt, some pear and apple fruitiness, a bit of earthy yeast, and a subtle metallic alcohol edge. The taste is rather sweet grainy malt, again with the drupe fruit character, some further mild dark fruits, a bit of caramel/toffee cracker, faint yeast, some faint musty hops, and a hovering, but generally well integrated hollow booziness.

The bubbles are fairly fine and neatly packed, no burbly outbursts here, the body a heady medium weight, and mostly smooth, a slight alcohol snag the only issue. It finishes pretty off-dry, the sweetness from the bready caramel malt and lingering fruitiness tamping down any other contenders.

An enjoyable and drinkable BSPA, not all that pale, but surely strong enough, that particular culprit hiding well in the complexity of the sugar components. Good stuff.Aug 19, 2012"

Smells of sweet malts, more like a malty coke than a beer. Swirling the glass kicked up a bit of barnyard.

Very thin flavor. Some mild malt and a little bit sweet. Aftertaste is similar to the smell of dry, uncooked quick oats (oatmeal). Might be better chilled cold on a hot day. Still working on the soft drink theme.

Quickly foams up like a beer, but still has a lot of tongue tingling carbonation like a coke.

Somewhat insipid. Boring. Overwhelmingly mild. This is far too much like a coke where some of the sugar has been replaced with a little malt and most of the flavor left out. A good beer for people who don't like beer.Feb 23, 2020"

Mouthfeel - Light to medium bodied with light to moderate carbonation. Finishes with the toffee sweetness and slight dark fruits.

Whistler Black Tusk Ale,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,"A - Poured a deep brown ruby colour with a one fingered head that dissipates fairly quickly to a thin film.

S - Roasted coffee and chocolate malts with a hint of dark fruit

T - Definite coffee and chocolate sweet malts with some caramel and toffee biscuit at the finish.

M - medium bodied with good carbonation and fairly smooth.

O - Not a bad drop. A fairly smooth and well balanced beer but a little bland overall.Jul 02, 2012"
Whistler Black Tusk Ale,4.0,4.0,3.5,2.5,"Bottle: decent old-school 330mL bottle, cool Canadian-style label. The beer name trumps it for me :)

Appearance: deep amber with ruby-black highlights. Light tan head with moderate retention.

Aroma: slightly grainy and sweet, with a touch of fruit overtones. Light aroma per the English mild style.

Taste: light roasted nut, caramel, biscuit, some berries, reasonable bitterness for a mild.

Aftertaste: the light flavour lingers slightly. Some malts and fruit remains.

Mouth feel: quite a light body, and light carbonation. Could have done with a bit more body to carry the flavour.

Overall: an interesting English Dark Mild Ale - has some grain and fruit flavours, with a touch of bitterness. Much better than most milds I have had, however it is 5% ABV, so maybe it isn't a true-to-style mild...Jun 28, 2012"
Whistler Black Tusk Ale,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,"Perhaps a bit strong for a mild, but that might be a good thing because the flavour is muted with filtering.

Deep amber with a light tan head, ring of retention leaves a little lace.

Aroma is slightly grainy and sweet, with a Brit-like fruityness.

Roasted nut, caramel, biscuit, hints of cocao and field berries, good bitterness.

Light to moderate body is pleasant enough.

Whistler Black Tusk Ale,3.5,2.5,2.0,3.0,"Pours a clear dark brown with a 2 inch puffy tan head that settles to a thin cap. Thin foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is pretty much only of toasty malt/grains. There is a slight onion aroma as the beer warms. Taste is of toasty/burnt malt and a slight onion/garlic flavor. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer. As it stands, Whistler is 0 for 2 in my book with their beers.Dec 22, 2011"
Whistler Black Tusk Ale,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,"Appearance - dark, with no head to speak of, and no lacing.

Smell - Faint roasted malt, not much to speak of.

Taste - Roasted malt, has a smoke flavor with hints of caramel.

Mouthfeel - medium body, pretty crisp and higher carbonation.

Drink - simple and easy drinking at a low ABV.

I don't know if this is classified right as an ""English Dark Mild Ale"". I can't really say, but it is a simple beer with a decent amount of flavor. Seems more like a smoked beer to me, but I have no clue. I have had other beers from this brewery and this is easily the best one they make.Mar 03, 2011"
Whistler Black Tusk Ale,3.5,2.0,3.5,3.0,"Bottle poured into a pint glass. Dark amber brown with a foamy off-white head. Aroma is nutty, slightly smokey, with caramel and a nice vomity note. Ugh. Fortunately that doesn't come through in the taste. Flavor is toasted caramel and bread with a whisper of smoke and a mineral water finish. Pretty thin with prickly carbonation.Jan 26, 2011"
Whistler Black Tusk Ale,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,"41ml bottle. The label depicts a wooly mammoth emerging, as if it were an outcropping, from a mountainside?

This beer pours a clear, very dark brownish amber colour, with a multitude of thin billowy and foamy pale beige head, which leaves some bulbous splotches of lace around the glass as it slowly and surely recedes. 

It smells of semi-sweet, toasted and crackery caramel malt, nutty dry chocolate, coffee beans, a bit of wet ash, and earthy, weedy hops. The taste is lightly roasted caramel malt, chocolate wafer, a bit of coffee grounds, oily nuts, a hint of dried dark fruit, and a soft leafy, earthy, and tempered hop bitterness. 

The carbonation is fairly mild, but still quite airy at times, the body a sturdy medium weight, adequately smooth, and perhaps even a tad creamy. It finishes off-dry, with a clean malty chocolate curtain-fall.

My first offering from this brewery, and I'm moderately impressed. More of a nut brown ale than the given classification, but whatever, it's an easy drinking, keep 'em comin', kind of beer. That poor mammoth could use a keg of this, or so, I would imagine!Dec 21, 2010"
Whistler Black Tusk Ale,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,"Poured from 330mL bottle into a pint glass.

Appearance: rich amber brown hue, clear body. Head is two fingers of creamy light-ivory foam, dissipating quickly and leaving a chunky lace. Pretty solid.

Smell: slightly sweet caramel malt aroma with a little nuttiness and biscuitiness. Kind of like a nut brown ale; light, but actually pretty good for a mild ale.

Taste: medium-sweet caramel malt with a very light nuttiness. Hops are very subtle but earthy, with a light bitterness toward the end. Actually pretty tasty.

Mouthfeel: medium-light body with quite a nice level of carbonation. Surprisingly full-bodied for a dark mild; I like it.

Drinkability: I found this highly drinkable and was quite impressed with this beer. I'd gladly have it again.Jul 18, 2010"
Whistler Black Tusk Ale,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pour: Deep brown color with two fingers of cream-colored head that dissipates somewhat fast and leaves a little bit of lacing on the glass. 

Smell: Caramel, chocolate, fruity, and a slight hint of coffee. No detectable hop aroma. 

Taste: Starts off with a very light sweet taste which gives way to a rather yeasty middle. Toward the back there is a bit of chocolate malt followed by a slight nutty character and finishes up with a light coffee bitterness. 

Mouthfeel: Light to medium with high carbonation. Very smooth. 

Drinkability: Goes down easy, more of a session beer. 

Final Notes: A tasty no-frills session beer that would pair well against a meal or for a night at the bar with friends. Nothing really special, but I can see myself buying it again.Jul 14, 2010"

Whistler Black Tusk Ale,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Had a bottle of this on a Horizon flight, served in a plastic cup (gasp!). Black Tusk Ale is a dark cola brown with a light sand head leaving scattered lace. 

Smell is malty, dark, some chocolate. 

Taste is like porter light, but with a decent amount of depth for a mild, chocolate, char, roast. 

Mouthfeel is where this beer really shined, very smooth and velvety, full carbonation, with a slick, lighter body. 

Drinkability is pretty good, really slid down easily, if not the most exciting beers in the world. One of the best beers I've had from Western CA.Mar 06, 2010"
Whistler Black Tusk Ale,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,"English Dark Mild Ale...and here I thought I was buying a Swartzbier. Who Knew?

Since this is the first of this type I'm gonna call it average, only because the head was fizzy and left the scence faster than a Lindsey Jacobellis in a snowboard cross olympic final.

Aroma is quite nice...certainly well balance between some roasted malts, chocolate, and a hint of smoke.

ANother weak starter and strong finisher. Watery pap until the rich roast malts quick in with a nice, mellow coffee, then chocolate feel. 

Weak and thin in the front end combined with a fizzy carbonation brings it into an average mouthfeel.

Wayyy better than their export lager...regardless I'm sure they're selling truckloads right now.Feb 17, 2010"
Whistler Black Tusk Ale,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,"Another brew from the sample pack my son from Seattle brought me for Xmas.

This one pours a deep cola brown into the Saison Dupont glass, small tan head tries to rise from the deck, but falls quickly.

Chocolate malt shake in the aroma, tidbits of roasted bread and coffee. Taste almost gets over the hump with the same flavors, but they lack an overall goodness and remain wimpy in the background. A hint, and a small one, of caramel helps in the finish. Not a bad beer, it would make a decent lawnmower brew, if not for the insane prices from the Canada boys.

My son says a case is like $40 US bucks. Nuts!Jan 27, 2010"
Whistler Black Tusk Ale,5.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,"Aroma: Light but defined aroma of coffee with a background of semi-sweet chocolate. As you go deeper into the subtle smells there are hints of white bread and a slight DMS.

Appearance: Light brown with excellent and translucent clarity. Pours a rich and fluffy off-white head, like the color of Latte foam. The head holds very well throughout the glass and forms a nice lacing along the sides. The color is only slightly darker than the brown bottle it resides in.

Flavor: The aroma of coffee follows into the flavor as expected, but also at the forefront on the tongue is a light but easily detectable roasted quality that is drying and slightly bitter. Hop bitterness follows this up with an earthy bite through the middle before the beer fades quickly to a clean finish.

Mouthfeel: Light to medium body with high carbonation. The sparkly carbonation has a tingling quality that continues throughout and leads into a drying finish. The hops come into play with a bit of a bite in the end, though not overwhelming by any means.

Overall: Generally light flavors and aromas throughout but what is presented has been done very cleanly and with an almost lager like crispness. The carbonation seems a little high for the beer itself, if it were backed off a bit then more body would be able to come out I believe. This is the first beer I've had from Whistler, and I'm looking forward to trying more of their lineup.

Edit: Noticing my rather high deviation I went back and reviewed the BJCP guidelines for this style. As an English Brown Ale (11A), I still feel this beer hits the mark in many ways.Jan 11, 2010"
Rogue American Amber Ale,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"2 fl. oz. bottle, as Rogue American Amber Ale, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. The beer starts pouring out of the bottle by its own will. Dark amber colour, moderate beige head. Malty and bready aroma, notes of bakery and caramel, also some fruity hops, hints of spices. The flavour is malty and earthy with caramel and toffee, decent hops in the finish.Dec 06, 2020"
Rogue American Amber Ale,4.0,2.75,3.75,4.25,"oz bottle

Pours two fingers of barely off white head into a concave water glass. Pretty normal looking, with a little soapiness as the head starts to fade. Head retention is a little above average, a pretty good film still lingers, and good initial lacing. Body looks more like a dark burnt orange than an amber. Visibility is low, looks cloudy. Looks like a medium amount of bubbles coming up. Looks very nice so far.

Nose is not amazing. Kinda has a characterless bitterness, with a one dimensional pale malt aroma. Almost extracty aroma. Not really any caramel or bread notes going on. It doesn't smell all too great.

Flavor is better than the nose thankfully. Medium amount of hops are here, which is an appropriate amount. The malt profile overall is a pretty good deep flavor, with a little rough spot at the end, but that's ok. Not getting too much extract flavor, which is good. Pretty well balanced. Good flavor.

Mouthfeel is good. Body and carbonation are about medium. Bitterness is appropriate and doesn't linger. Sugars do not stick, and it's sessionable. Nice mouthfeel.

The drinkability is very good. It's a well balanced beer that isn't too heavy.

The appearance turned out decent. Spotty lacing, but not terrible. Pretty good initial pour and retention.

Overall an interesting revisit to this beer. The nose was way off, but the flavor was about what I remembered it to be. One of the better beers from Rogue's flagship line, not quite as stellar this time around, but still a good flavor.

Note: Couldn't initially find a bottling date, but on further inspection I could make out a bottling date of 4 months ago. In an amber, I feel like that shouldn't make a huge difference. But maybe it was slightly oxidized, and that explains the nose? Regardless, I bought this from the brewery, and they should not be selling old product.Jan 04, 2019"

Rogue American Amber Ale,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Reviewed from notes. The appearance has a amber colored body that leaves a half finger white head, lasts for about thirty seconds and then dies. The body is too dark for any carbonation to be seen rising. No lacing was seen at all. The smell has some roasty hops combined very nicely with some caramels and coffee. The taste has some bitter hops coming out a bit stronger and giving a quick bite and allows a slow flavor of the coffee and caramel coming out. On the palate, she sits about a medium with nothing obscure on the tongue, just an overall basic good feel. Overall, I like this and would have it again.Jun 25, 2017"

Rogue American Amber Ale,4.0,3.75,3.75,4.0,"From notes taken 04/04/16:

Mostly opaque, deep copper with amber golden hues in the light. Fine, creamy beige head of moderate retention, mediocre but attractive lacing. Caramel and toffee aromas the strongest, but smells very berry-like. Evidently, quite malty. Loads of caramel and toffee still to the taste, but more so date-like than berries. Tart. Earthy, leafy, leathery hops set in within the first second or so, and grow and reverberate well through to the finish. Nice pleasantly bitter aftertaste, more rindiness now detectable. Hop bitterness, in the balance, makes malty character seem just a little watered down. Fairly dry. Medium- to full-bodied, soft, sloshy, gulpable, fine, but medium carbonation for the most part. Yet, prickly around the edges, in a manner of speaking. Slight astringency to it. Refreshing.Apr 06, 2016"

Brew pours a medium-amber in color with a good 1+-finger foamy off-white head. Lots of lacing is seen when sipped that stuck to the sides of the glass when sipped. Aroma is of bready yeasts, caramel malts with a hint of citrus. Taste is close to the nose with some brown sugar and floral hops also. Does have a slightly bitter finish but doesn't last too long.

Rogue American Amber Ale,3.0,3.75,3.75,3.0,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass

Appearance – The beer pours a deep amber color with a one finger head of pure white foam. The head fades fairly quickly leveling a little bit of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

Smell – The aroma is quite strong of a caramel and lightly toasted smell. Along with these aromas comes some smells of a light bready and somewhat fruity smell with apricot and pear as well as a hint of nuttiness.

Taste – The taste begins with a toasted malt flavor mixed with some lighter caramel and brown sugar sweetness. There is also a decent level of a more herbal and earthy hop upfront. These two hop flavors fade however, with them being replaced by more sweet caramel and brown sugar tastes. While much of the hop fades, other hops do end up taking their place, with a bit of a grassy hop joining the flavor profile. With a little bit of a fruity flavor of pear and plum joining the flavor at the end, one is left with a pleasant and somewhat smooth malty taste to linger on the tongue.

Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the thinner and slightly more watery side with a carbonation level that is rather average. A little thicker of a body may have been slightly more appropriate for the caramel and brown sugar mixed with the toasted taste, but overall the feel was alright and did a decent job for the brews tastes.

Overall – A rather easy drinking brew overall with a good flavor. Nothing too spectacular, but a very easy drinker and a good go to for beer drinkers of varying taste preferences.Nov 30, 2014"
Rogue American Amber Ale,3.75,3.25,3.0,2.75," oz bottle into a wine glass. Wait, didn't I just pour a Rogue beer a few minutes ago? Oh yeah, I did. Ah well, here goes nothing...

Appearance: Pours a darker copper color. The head is a finger high, with a pale yellow shade. The texture is very thick (even for an amber ale), though the retention isn't the best. A consistent ring of lacing is left on the glass. (3.75)

Smell: The aroma is redolent of your typical amber ale. Light Cascade hoppiness (flowers, lime, and minor grapefruit) is balanced by the healthy caramel-laden backbone. Really, it doesn't smell bad at all, just a bit unexciting. Just like I said, it's a standard (albeit well-done) amber ale. (3.25)

Taste: Again, no surprises here. It starts off with light hints of grapefruit and piny hops, while the finish is fairly malty. I'm getting vague vanilla cream flavors on the back end that are pretty nice. These elements strike a nice balance, though personally I could use a bit more hoppiness. Rogue's sometimes problematic yeast strain does a good job of staying in the background here. Nothing special, but it works acceptably. (3) 

Mouthfeel: I don't think this is dry enough - while the hop/malt balance in the taste is nice, some of the maltiness lingers far too strongly. Ergo, it's not terribly easy to drink. Carbonation is slightly on the low side, making it seem a tad syrupy. (2.75)

Overall: Before drinking this, I had Rogue's Yellow Snow IPA...incidentally, it tasted exactly like eating yellow snow, so I dumped it. This, though, is far superior. Sure, it's just another average amber ale, but I'd gladly drink the whole bottle of this over just a couple ounces of the aptly named former beer. So...uh...um, good job, Rogue. (3)

I was quite disappointed with this one after expecting a lot more from it given the reviews it gets here & the fact that it is a Rogue beer but it failed to deliver for me with the taste being a particular let down. There was a decent enough malt taste to the beer but I had been expecting more hops to it as well & just more flavour really. At first I feared the can was past its best but when I checked the date it was a mere couple of months old so that doesn't seem to be the problem, it just seems like this beer wasn't for me and its not one I'll go back to I'm afraid.Nov 10, 2014"

Mouth: Descent brew. It packed a bit of body and resembles a Vienna lager with a shot of sugar but needed a little something extra that I was looking for. Still not bad and great brew to start the night with. Salud!Aug 10, 2019"
San miguel Dark Lager,4.0,3.75,3.75,4.0,"Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a medium to dark reddish orange with a fine, one finger khaki head with great retention and thick lacing; looks nice. Aroma of lightly toasted biscuit malt, light notes of molasses and cocoa. Flavor is semi-sweet medium dark toasted malt, cocoa, brown bread with light nutiness. Finishes with more of the same, smooth and balanced, if a little light in depth. Medium bodied with light creaminess, nice for this ABV. I'm not quite sure why there is such lack of love for this here. While it's not a robust dark beer, it is a good looking, well integrated and nice tasting Euro dark lager; reminiscent of a lighter brown ale in profile. The malt and cocoa flavors are good with other light notes like the brown bread and molasses. It is light to moderate in flavor, not a deeply flavored lager, but the flavors here are very nice and satisfying. I'm actually glad to know that this around, because I'd get this in a heart beat at a restaurant with a non-craft beer selection. Relatively light, but enjoyable.Mar 11, 2018"

Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toasted dark bread, brown sugar, and nuttiness; with lighter notes of molasses, toffee, coffee, dark fruit, slight herbal/grass, and roast/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt and light earthy hop/fruity yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toasted dark bread, and nuttiness; with lighter notes of molasses, toffee, coffee, dark fruit, slight herbal/grass, and roast/toasted earthiness. Light herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toasted dark bread, brown sugar, nuttiness, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and light earthy hop/fruity yeast flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light dryness from hop/roast bitterness as well. Fairly clean on lager flavors; some light fruitiness and minimal off flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly sticky/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5%. Overall this is a good dark lager style.

A head about three fingers tall forms and displays good retention. Aroma of caramel and dark toffee. Faint notes of brown sugar and soy. Floral notes contributed by the hops.

It's got a malt-forward flavor profile with a balancing bitterness that follows right behind the initial malty sweetness. A little bit of charred malt on an otherwise bland finish. Slick texture, devoid of any harshness from the carbonation. This is just an eminently drinkable dark beer that compares somewhat favorably with German-brewed dunkels. Good stuff.Jul 18, 2016"
San miguel Dark Lager,3.75,3.25,3.0,3.25,"I spent some time in the P.I. (Philippine Islands) in my early-20s as a young sailor. Somehow, I came away disease-free & unmarried, although both were certainly an option. I had public sex in a hammock over there and hung up my boxing gloves for good after receiving a slashing blow that damn near broke my nose. You can imagine my excitement when my neighbor (a bottle shop) recently put out singles of this one!

From the bottle: ""Expertly Brewed from the Finest Ingredients""; ""A distinctive lager brewed with roasted malt for a rich, bittersweet taste and pleasant aroma. Expertly brewed in the San Miguel tradition of excellence - the ultimate choice for discriminating drinkers.""

""Discriminating""?!? Not me! That said, I Pop!ped the cap & let fly. I watched in fascination as just over a finger of dense, deep-tan/light-brown head formed & then fell. Color was as advertised - Dark, as in Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing zero light penetration. Nose had a carob-like smell. Interesting. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste had a medicinal sharpness, like Geritol, so my initial thought of carob was not too far from the mark. Finish was slightly sour, slightly bitter, but very reminiscent of either carob or Geritol. I remain a fan of regular Sammy GooGoo & if I find out that this is being CANned, I will revisit it, but In this format, it a one-and-done.Jul 05, 2016"

San miguel Dark Lager,2.75,3.25,3.5,3.0,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass

Appearance – The beer pours a very dark brown, nearly black color with a tiny fizzy head of cream colored foam. The head fades almost instantly, leaving just a trace of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. 

Smell – The aroma of the beer is strongest of a roasted malt smell mixed with a bit of chocolate and smoke. Along with these aromas comes a little bit of grain and a hint of dark fruit.

Taste – The taste begins with a mix of a roasted malt taste and a bit of a molasses and chocolate sweetness. As the taste moves on the roast seems to fade a little bit with more sweetness of molasses, chocolate, and some corn syrup coming to the tongue. With a little bit of a smoke and toast developing at the very end, a moderately sweet, but easy drinking darker taste is left on the tongue. 

Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is on the slightly thinner and crisper side with a carbonation level that is rather average. For the abv. and lager style the slightly thinner body was rather nice, but for the darker flavors of the brew a little less carbonation and thicker body may have been slightly more appropriate. Overall, the feel was rather decent.

Overall – A decent dark lager, but nothing all that out of the ordinary. Just alright overall.Nov 29, 2015"

This has a pesky metallic flavor to it that I don't love, but it's not all that bad. There's some chocolate and char flavors, with some roasted malt flavor as well. Not all that bold, but not bad either.

San miguel Dark Lager,3.0,2.75,2.75,3.0,"Pours a dark amber-red in color, darker than fizzy non-alcoholic cola-pop, and is brilliant or with excellent clarity. Pale tan head looks pretty good, with tight, small bubbles and uniform rather than rocky. Looks good is a glass...

The nose is sweet, malty, a little neutral and boring. But there's an off-note, medicinal as well. Plus, there's a oxidation to this one that makes me believe that the bottle I pulled from the undated six pack is fairly old.

Sweet and lightly-tangy on the first sip. The roast malt character which features in the language on the label is rather minimal. Finish is dry, but the oxidation is interfering with the nicer character of the malt (dark fruit notes, of plum and date, which I ordinarily love in stronger, richer ales.)

The body is thin. Carbonation is okay -- neither under or over-carbonated.

Altogether I can see this as being a nice, easy-drinker in the summer heat, as it's not too strong and is rather refreshing in its own right. It's not bad for the price I paid for it ($6.99), but I'm sure it would be a better beer within code!Jan 26, 2015"

Overall / Drinkability: I've had this before and I remember it with more fondness then, but it was the summer and I had it with a spicy meal, which is where I think this beer would shine better.

330 ml brown glass bottle, ""BEST BEFORE END: 02/2020"" and sampled on 10/15/2019
$1.99 @ Total Wine & More, Cherry Hill, NJ

Notes via stream of consciousness: The body is a clear, very dark mahogany brown with a ruby sheen to it beneath a full head of dark tan foam. The aroma is caramelish and fruity with a berry-like note. The flavor follows but there's more of a molasses than caramel note to it. A touch of herbal character rounds it out a bit. I'll assume that's coming from hops, but it's not that bitter; although that's OK because it is fairly nicely balanced for what it is. It dries in the finish but leaves a dollop of dark sugar sweetness behind. It's medium-light in body and gently effervescent and crisp. The head has dropped by this point but it still maintains almost a completely solid surface covering and there's some nice lacing left behind. In the end I fear that the dark color is probably achieved through coloring as I'm not finding chocolate-like notes or roastiness, but that's OK, this is a different kind of beer. It's more of a schwarzbier but it's got a sweeter caramel note to it and some fruitiness. Hmmmm, maybe I'm wrong, maybe the color is coming just from darker caramel malts. Either way, it's good for what it is, and a nice change of pace.

Super Bock Stout,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,"(330 ml bottle; best by 02/2020; purchased single off shelf... poured into a fat tulip)

L: rather dark, chestnut-brown liquid; clarity oscuro; tall, tan head on pour, collapses fast into thin cap; some smears of lace

S: molasses cake, cigar resin, hint of espresso... this is straight-up doppelbock-lite, and it smells fantastic... bit of a time-worn leather tone creeps in

T: almost an Irish dry stout malty roastiness - its malt layering a few degrees more rich though... dark bread-crusty, malted dark chocolate milkshake character sweeping in during the finish and never leaving... not sweet, though mellow essence of dark caramel; bitterness, mostly from the (coffee-ish) roast... pervading aftertaste of dark, dry caramel, with that leathery musk, almost a mild herbal amaro note as well

F: frothy spread; mild sense of warmth fills the palate... brief oily viscosity up front, immediately fanned out by the suds, but then it later creeps back in the finish

O: not a 'stout', but maybe a type of Baltic Porter, eh? - the lack of booze could deny it that though... what a surprise! - like a black-and-brown of a Guinness draught and Andechser Doppelbock??... I have no idea why y'all received this so lukewarm (1472)Aug 23, 2019"

Super Bock Stout,3.25,3.25,3.0,3.0,"On-draught @ Cafe Santiago in Porto.

Dark bready taste with a blip of roasted barley. Sweet but appropriately attenuated. Balanced albeit simple. Medium-bodied, somewhat filling, smooth, wet, unrefreshing, and overcarbonated. Nice cohesion of flavour; this captures the conventions of the style with no ornamentation.

More depth of flavour and complexity are needed for this to really impress, but it's a nice simple dark brew. Some pungent roast and more vivid notes of caramel, nougat, et al. Would love it up.

I think there's a hint of something from the licorice family (e.g. fennel) in there, but it's reticent.

Probably my favourite of Super Bock's lineup.

Super Bock Stout,3.25,3.0,2.75,2.75,"Where did this come from? Is it a stout, a bock, a porter, or a schwarzbier?
I have no answers to either of these questions.

The color is nearly black and the tan head thin. It sits on top with some pretty reasonable substance and lays down decent lacing.
This one presents lots of roasty notes with a bit of char, not the unpleasant kind at first but then going a little burnt. There's a metallic presence as well. The aroma has some notes of cream that don't quite follow in the flavor, though a hint of licorice is noticeable in both. Overall, if the bitter burnt note could be kept in check, it would be better. Surprisingly, it's not terrible.
The feel is a touch confusing, a little underdone and thin but dry to the point of feeling like concord grape and leaving a bit of a tingle. The char hits on the end somewhat.Apr 11, 2016"

Widmer Brothers Nelson Imperial IPA,4.5,4.0,4.0,3.75," oz bottle was poured into a snifter. 

Appearance: A one finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer. It is a slightly hazy pale orange color with good vision of bubbles coming up through the glass. Nice lacing down the glass as the beer was drank. 

Smell: Citrus, floral, herbal, tropical, grassy, and caramel.

Taste: Same as above with mild hop bitterness. 

Mouthfeel: Smooth, medium bodied, a little booze, medium carbonation, and some malty sweetness. 

Overall: This mixture of hops are awesome. Tropical, herbal, and citrus. Alcohol is hidden well too.May 24, 2014"
Widmer Brothers Nelson Imperial IPA,3.75,4.0,4.0,4.0,"A: Dull amber with a frothy off-white head.

S: Loads of tropical fruit.

T: Big, welcoming tropical fruit and orange peel. Very sharp. Let's allow it to warm up. A suggestion of tea-leaves. Lovely level of sweetness, which is why it's a bit sticky. It's got that strong alcoholic syrupy quality, like a barley wine. Has a nice bitter backbone and while there's enough malt to carry the hops there's no particular malt character.

M: Right amount of carbonation.

O: A very generic tasting American IPA and certainly not the best example I've had. With these fruit bombs I tend to be blown away by the first few glugs and desperately bored by the last few. Overall, a little bit two dimensional but I enjoyed drinking it none the less.Apr 03, 2014"
Widmer Brothers Nelson Imperial IPA,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,"a: the beer pours a nice clear copper/amber but has almost no head, just ring of white bubbles; there is some light, lazy movement in the glass.

s: light fruity, citrusy hop in the front of the nose but the dominant smell is that sort of thick sweet hoppy smell; 

t: no surprise that the taste has hops some earthy/spicy hops, but the main taste for me is that sort of muddled syrupy hops/malt blend that too many IPAs have; the beer is not bad for me, but i really dislike it when IPAs favor this sort of muddled thick hop taste over a crisp refreshing one -- common for the style, but not required. 

m: medium mouthfeel that is slick and a little oily, and a bit mouthcoating - moderate-faint carb, but tight tiny bubbles. 

d: to me this beer gets lost as another sort of OK IPA that s too sweet and does not make the best of its substantial ABV and hops. missed opportunity.Jan 14, 2014"
Widmer Brothers Nelson Imperial IPA,3.75,3.75,4.0,3.75,"A: The beer is very hazy golden orange in color and has a light amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a quarter finger high beige colored head that quickly died down, leaving a collar of large bubbles around the edge of the glass.
S: Nelson Sauvin hops impart light to moderate aromas of gooseberries and tropical fruits to the nose; hints of grapefruit from the Cascade hops are also noticeable.
T: The taste mostly follows the smell and is dominated by flavors of gooseberries along with notes of passionfruit and grapefruit. While only a light amount of bitterness is perceptible, only hints of the underlying malts are perceptible.
M: It feels medium-bodied and somewhat crisp on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This beer is quite drinkable because the taste masks any traces of alcohol. There's a very good balance between the malts and bitterness, but there's hardly much of any of them in the taste to make you believe that this beer is an Imperial IPA. The variety of different hops used in this beer result in an interesting flavor profile.Jan 14, 2014"

Widmer Brothers Nelson Imperial IPA,3.75,4.25,4.25,3.5,"Transparent orange/gold beer with a thin head with good retention. Citrus & floral hops in the nose, thick on the tongue, maybe a tad too ""syrupy"" for my tastes. Sweet but not quite too sweet. Hops don't kick in immediately, they're much more noticeable in the finish. Individual hop flavors stand out, hitting the tongue one after the other: super fruity, almost like jolly ranchers! Intense orange/grapefruit and other citrusy flavors, slightly bitter finish, fairly dry. I think I would like this beer more if it weren't so ""big"". There is a lot of amazing flavor squeezed out of the hops without any heavy bitterness.Dec 13, 2013"
Widmer Brothers Nelson Imperial IPA,4.0,3.75,4.25,4.0,"poured from a bottle into a wine glass, comparing it head to head with Green Flash Green Bullet Triple IPA and New Belgium Imperial IPA.

I've heard of Widmer Brothers, but didn't think of them as a ""craft"" beer brewer until today. I read about this IPA and was anxious to try it. It did not disappoint...

Lovely dark amber color, and subtle hop aroma and flavor. Subtle... nice, but not overwhelming. You can taste the malted barley with the hop flavor balancing it.

this is a beer I will come back to again... not a bargain, but a well crafted IPA that I will look forward to enjoying againSep 22, 2013"
Widmer Brothers Nelson Imperial IPA,3.0,4.75,3.75,3.5,"A: Pours with a solid head but low retention. Melts away quickly into a clumpy layer of mid sized bubbles. A nice golden yellow-orange color

S: Incredible. One of the best smells I have encountered in a while. Such a unique IPA. The traditional spicy smell of ""hops"" is there, but quite subtle. Smells of grapes, peaches, floral grass, honey - but amazingly not all that sweet. Clean

T: A bit muted in comparison to the smell. Not so bright, but full and rich. Tastes like heavy wine; dried raisins and spice add to the heaviness. Interesting how the hop spice tastes like wine pairing spices.

M: Lighter in the mouthfeel than in the whole sip experience. 

O: A very interesting and lovely beer. A different experience from your typical IPA. Absolutely worth trying. I would certainly drink more.Aug 23, 2013"
Widmer Brothers Nelson Imperial IPA,4.25,4.0,3.5,3.75,"Enjoyed in an IPA glass over 25 minutes.
The base has a soft orange glow, as the density if haze is just sufficiently permissive of light. Streams of carbonation are visible through the haze. A generous french-vanilla head holds on rather well, leaving creamy lumps that feed lacing for much of the time one spends with a serving.
The smell is bracing, bright, and bitter. Grapefruit coated in ginger leaps up and seems to grab taste buds through the nose even before a sip. Accompanying must increases with standing, and it morphs into fungal cheese warmth. Sweetness tracks with the funk and brings along other subtle fruit scents like cherry, mango, and a little apricot. It's a marvelous blend, but the fungus begins to overwhelm an earlier grassiness with time.
Right from the first sip, much of the taste profile represents contrast. It's surprisingly sweet. Hops are prominent through their oils and esters that are cut lightly by a squeeze of lime. It's fairly metallic and boozy through the middle. The bitterness that characterized the early nose finally enters the back end of the taste profile along with an aftertaste of earth and pine. Malt holds the center with a touch of allspice all the way through to keep together an otherwise haphazard collection of flavors.
It's nice and slick over the teeth, and could use more carbonation to cut the heavy layering effect over the tongue The beer continues to be chewy long after a swallow, hanging onto the back of the tongue with piney hop-oils.
I think my expectations interfered with the possibility of enjoying this brew more. They were enhanced by the initial sights and smells, but the flavor just doesn't have me reaching for more. Although, my bottle had been sitting too long, and even though I kept it cold, I don't think I had the as good and balanced an experience as I might have, based on what I read in others' fresher reviews.Aug 23, 2013"
Widmer Brothers Nelson Imperial IPA,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Got a 4 pack of this for 7.50 at BevMo here in Phoenix. Figured I'd try it since it was relatively cheap for an IIPA. 

A - Nice clear orange color to it, a little paler than other iIPAs, big frothy white head, still a thick ring when it dies down. Leaves perfect rings of lacing on the glass. 

S - Rich maltiness with a citrusy/piney hop background. Definitely some grapefruit, lemon/lime, and orange in there too. Nice smell to it.

T - Hop forward. A lot of citrusy hop flavors up front, grapefruit/orange/lemon/lime/mango with a bitterness and pine flavor in the background. Leaves a piney aftertaste that's nice. From the smell I was expecting the malt backbone to be more intense but it's actually really well balanced and good for the style of beer. 

M - Nice, light mouthfeel. ABV well hidden at 8.6%. It's an alternative to Hoptimum, which is a little bit more alcohol forward (but also over 10% alc). This beer is really well balanced. 

O - Well balanced, good IIPA option. Doesn't live up to Ruination or Hop Stoopid but comes close to Stone IPA and Firestone Walker Union Jack. However, I would definitely say the price played into it.Aug 01, 2013"
Widmer Brothers Nelson Imperial IPA,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Pale copper color,clear as a bell,fluffy two finger bone white head sticks around well before leaving some sticky lacing in the glass, well carbonated.

Aroma is nicely hoppy, but moderately so, malt is barely noticeable.The Nelson hops have a pleasant nose in this IIPA.

Taste is grapefruit/orange rind & pine, slight lingering bitterness on the swallow.The malt has a slight introduction in the initial taste,but not in an overpowering way.

Mouthfeel is very nice, light medium,crisp and dry finish.

Always a good thing when you are pleasantly surprised by a purchase made on a hunch. I was on vacation in Maine and decided to grab this one on a whim, and it turned out to be a solid selection.If you like hops over malt, and a smooth drinker, pick this one up!Jul 31, 2013"

Widmer Brothers Nelson Imperial IPA,4.25,3.0,3.25,4.25,"Note: this review is primarily for myself. I received a four-pack as a gift and unfortunately it was a good 8-months old. Given the other reviews on this site I would like to try the fresh version.

A - a nice clear amber with about an inch of head. The head faded, but never disappeared, and left a really nice amount of lacing on the glass all the way down.

S - Maltiness, the hops have faded on this 8-month old beer.

T - actually tasted something like the Lagunitas Undercover Investigation Shutdown Ale, which I found both too malty and too boozy. I don't think the level of alcohol is the problem with this one, so I'm chalking it up to old age.

M - Classic DIPA feel. Soft, medium-full body.

O - I argued with myself over whether or not to review it, but ultimately I'd rather have the record, and a reminder to give this one a fair shot.Jun 12, 2013"
Widmer Brothers Nelson Imperial IPA,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,"Clear amber with one finger of off white head. Head fades in 5 minutes leaving a curtain of lace behind.
Smell is quite bold, hop oil and some grains.
Taste is grapefruit zest, resin, leather, pineapple, and some homemade short cake.
Mouthfeel is thick and chewy with just enough carbonation to steer it clear of wine territory.
Overall a nice beer from Widmer. Finish is a piney lingering slightly wet bitterness. Alcohol was noticed but in the effects rather than the taste.Jun 10, 2013"
Widmer Brothers Nelson Imperial IPA,4.25,4.25,4.75,4.25,"Pour is a glowing golden amber orange with a half finger of dense white head. Modest amount of lacing.

Nose is mighty strong, with lots of ripe, floral hops, and bright citrus character. 

Taste follows the nose, with big fresh juicy fruits, passion fruit, a little grape fruit. Luscious throughout. Finishes with nice pine resin hop, with just a softest bitters too it.

Mouth feel is on the thicker side of medium. Works well with the flavors.

Really a fantastic DIPA. Love all the fruit and flavors. Could have used just a touch more hop on the finish for me, but really phenomenal overall.May 15, 2013"
Widmer Brothers Nelson Imperial IPA,4.25,5.0,4.0,4.0,"A - Poured from Bomber into standard pint. Has a hazy golden/yellow color to it. Low amount of bubbles from carbonation, and a thin layer of white head on top. Good amount of lacing. 

S - The smell is just plain awesome. I get hints of caramel malt, earthy, and citrus tones. Hops come through but not overwhelming. 

T - Caramel is still there, but the hos come through for me more on taste than they do on smell. The citrus from the hops offers a really nice balance to the sweetness from the malt. Bitterness lingers after each sip. For being 8.6% it does not have an 'alcoholic' taste to it.

M - This drink is on the thicker side, but the carbonation comes out well when it is sipped. This helps it dissipate over the tongue quite nicely. 

O - I was very pleased with this beer, not knowing much about it when I purchased it. The aroma is really my favorite part. The entire experience was enjoyable and I would buy this again (It's a good price for the quality!).May 13, 2013"
Widmer Brothers Nelson Imperial IPA,4.0,4.25,4.0,4.5,"Having visited the Widmer Brothers Gasthaus during my many trips to Portland, Oregon (See Review), I was delighted to find their beers here in the Washington, DC area. 

Nelson Imperial begins with a moderate head nestled atop a translucent copper body, which is home to a small, but determined, school of carbonation bubbles racing one another to the surface. The rim bears minor lacing that eventually slips away to leaves a resinous film stubbornly stuck to the glass. 

The initial whiff is a plentiful bouquet of pine, apple and grass, which would be appropriate for taking a horse to the senior prom. Ha Ha – Charlie Babbitt told a joke. But enough of Rain Man references; the palate is immediately wrapped with a heavy blanket threaded with large spools of malt. At the end of the quaff, there is a subtle buttery texture making for a substantial mouthfeel.

As a Hop Head, I can attest to this exemplary version of our most popular style (IMHO). The Nelson Imperial proves that you can have hoppiness without the usual explosion of bitterness. But after all, it is brewed in Beervana - nuff said.May 12, 2013"

O - tart and tasty.Mar 29, 2013"
Widmer Brothers Nelson Imperial IPA,4.0,4.0,3.75,3.5,"Bottled on date of October 12, 2012

Appearance - Pours a hazy golden copper with an off-white finger width head and fair retention. Lacing clumps in spots, and is spotty in others. Nice stick.

Smell - I can smell the caramel malts from a mile away. Hops are secondary, coming across as floral with touches of citrus.

Taste - Caramel malts are predominant to start, with lesser notes of orange popping through cleanly by mid-taste. Lightly floral. Mild grapefruit pith bitterness comes across in the aftertaste, which builds after each sip.

Mouthfeel - Medium to full body with fair carbonation. Dry finish.

Overall - I should have checked the date before buying the bottle. At nearly 5 months old, I'm sure the hop bite in this beer has taken a substantial hit. I still enjoyed it, but a definite candidate for re-review with a fresher sample. I'm guessing I didn't get the Full Nelson experience (yes, pun intended).

UPDATE: Had this fresh on tap the other night, and there wasn't much of a difference. The hops were maybe a smidgeon stronger. Maybe.Mar 05, 2013"
Widmer Brothers Nelson Imperial IPA,4.25,4.25,4.0,3.75,"Picked up a bomber at the Foodland Grocery Store in Kapaa, Kauai last week for around $6. Bottled on 12-9-12.

Beer poured golden orange with a nice white head that is leaving lacing behind.

Nose is very pungent with floral and citrus hops.

Taste is hop forward, tropical notes were first noticed but grapefruit and pine are asserting dominance. Malt backbone is strong but not sweet.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied with some carbonation that makes it lighter than most in this style.

Overall i like this brew, good flavors and solid aroma are nice. Widmer bros have been stepping in up over time which is really appreciated!Mar 05, 2013"
Widmer Brothers Nelson Imperial IPA,4.25,4.0,3.5,3.75,"A: Clear orange-amber in color. Forms a moderate sized off-white head. Good retention and lacing. 

S: Aroma is characteristically Nelson Sauvin, with a strong grapey, vinous, white wine quality. 

T: Taste is weak and watery for a DIPA. Mild caramel malts, white grapes, mandarin orange, and peaches. Rather fruity for a DIPA. Moderately sweet. Foxy white wine on the finish. 

M: On the lighter side of medium. Thin for the style. Mild bitterness. Lower-medium carbonation. 

O: This is a weak DIPA and at 8.6% I'd say its barely pushing the DIPA boundary. However, I suspect that with a hop like Nelson Sauvin, the goal was to make a lighter styled beer to showcase the hop. In that sense they succeeded, but they did not succeed in making a beer that is overly memorable or special.Feb 24, 2013"
Widmer Brothers Nelson Imperial IPA,4.0,3.75,4.0,4.0,"A - orangish amber with a big, white head that fades to a thin lacing

S - huge floral aroma with some underlying citrus and sweet malts

T - floral, citrus, faintly spicy, faintly herbal, some orange, orange rind, sugary sweetness, mildly bitter finish

M - dry, well carbonated, a bit warm, well carbonated

This is a nice IPA, but it doesn't have the intense hop character that I would have liked. I do like the orange, citrusy notes that come through and the faint herbal notes. Ultimately, however, for a DIPA this is underwhelming. It's a solid, drinkable IPA, but not a great DIPA. I definitely will never turn this down, but I won't seek it out.Feb 17, 2013"
Coedo Beniaka,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Brew: Coedo Brewery (Kyodo Shoji Koedo Brewery) – Beniaka

Intro: 12 oz. poured into a tulip glass. Shared with a friend 

Appearance: Dark reddish brown in color. Minimal head, maybe 1 inch. Minimal lacing as we drank

Smell: Sweet. Not much else

Taste: Followed along with the smell. Not cloyingly sweet. Was expecting a heavy sweet potato taste but not so much. Was surprisingly balanced.

Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Carbonation helps this beer a lot

Drink: A little goes a long way. Wouldn’t want to much of this one.

Conclusion: Happy to have tried the style but would not revisit. Oddly enough, this was my last needed style to try until BA added Lager – Festbier just the day before so this is style #113 for me.Sep 15, 2021"
Coedo Beniaka,4.0,3.75,4.0,4.0,"First Happoshu, whatever that means.

This one pours a slightly murky brown color, with a small white head, and lots of lacing.

I don’t know what a happoshu is supposed to taste like. But this kinda feels pumpkin-ale-ish, with a fleshy sweet potato sweetness, some floral type character, and a bit of breadiness. 

This is creamy, and pretty drinkable, with a slightly slick finish.

I didn’t know what to expect with this, and I also don’t know what to expect if I have another happoshu in my life. Aside from all that it was pretty tasty.Feb 15, 2020"

A muted sweetness and caramel taste dominates the flavors; a smidgen of cola in the background; fine and subtle bitterness permeates it all. Medium body; softy prickly; semi-sweet overall.

This beer reminds me of a brown ale. It is nicely balanced and intriguingly complex. I do not know what sweet potatoes add to the beer overall, but there is no overt presence of them to be found. Good and righteous...Dec 18, 2019"

Coedo Beniaka,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.75,"L- Very deep chestnut brown. 3mm fine off-shite head clearing to lacing.
S- It has a distinctive and somewhat earthy aroma.
T- The flavour is also quite disctinctive, but then again it's the first beer I've had made with sweet potatoes! That said the difference is quite subtle, if I didn't know re: the sweet potatoes I wouldn't have guessed the recipe was that far off-piste. 
F- It has as much body and mouthfeel as you'd expect from a 7.0%, it is over in the 'winter-warmer' category in my opinion. Very drinkable, nothing notable is out of place. I'd drink it again, though if I'd pay for it at the price I paid is another matter.
O- Above and beyond the Japanese mass-market beers, they really do produce some very interesting beers. They tend to be damned expensive, both over there, and I previously lived in Tokyo, so of course over here too. But what I notice, and appreciate is that the JPnese are perfectionists, and there is rarely if ever anything to find fault with in higher end beers like Coedo (Hitachino Nest, etc).

Coedo Beniaka,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Pours a dirty brown color - cloudy and somewhat hazy. Thin tan head dissipates util there is about a quarter inch of velvety foam that lingers for some time. Solid head retention. 

Aroma is interesting - there is some spice, bready malts, sweat potato, and some soapy vegetal hops. This is frankly unlike any beer I've ever smelled. Almost reminds me of an overly old spiced pumpkin ale ... 

Taste has notes of bready malts initially - it tastes like a lager up front. You then get this spicy peppery note along with a sweet potato note and a bitter earthy finish. 

Feel is light to medium bodied. The bitterness coats the mouth and leaves a lingering sensation in the back of the mouth. Mild to moderate carbonation. 

Overall this is a truly unique beer - my first and only experience with Happoshu. This particular example is a solid beer - but would seem to me to be more of an acquired taste.May 01, 2018"
Coedo Beniaka,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium reddish browna with a fizzy light khaki head that dissipates quickly to a thin film that is then persistant. Aroma of biscuit malt and unidentifiable vegetable that does smell somewhat like sweet potato if you are expecting it; mostly malty and vegetal. Flavor is semi-sweet biscuit malt, slight brown sugar and light sweet potato, mildly earthy with a malty and lightly grassy op finish. Medium bodied with light creaminess and good mouth feel. I got this because I've enjoyed sweet potato ales in the past and always looking for craft offerings from Japan. I was a little discouraged to see somewhat low ratings for this, especially after the odd vegetable notes in the aroma. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor, which has genuine sweet potato character, but well balanced by the malt, which has a nice dark malt profile similar to a bock. This is not a typical happoshu and at the top of the ABV range for the style; I'd probably characterize it as a vegetable beer. I guess I'm fan of sweet potato beers and I rather liked this.Feb 07, 2018"
Coedo Beniaka,4.0,3.75,3.75,3.75,"a brown ale brewed with sweet potato, a very cool beer that i have not seen for sale in colorado before now. the bottles are neat, custom glass with the letters of the brewery stamped in to the neck. we rarely see japanese craft brands here, so this was an exciting one to find. a light brown dark amber mahogany beer with a swiftly rising white airy head with excellent retention, crystal clear and pretty in the glass. aroma is a little sweet, sort of starchy and earthy and candied, baked, warming and autumnal but also very simple, lacking the cocoa profile of a lot of brown ales despite the color, and thats true in the flavor too. there is a nice nuttiness to this, a pleasant even sweetness throughout, maple syrup and brown sugar, but it stays drinkable. i want to taste more of the sweet potato, i think a lot of it is fermented out, and it makes the malt base seem kind of thin and overly simple for the style. a little more roast and chocolate character here would be awesome, but i like it being a little lighter and easy drinking too. i am surprised the potato isnt more obvious in the flavor. i am also used to japanese beers having interesting yeast characteristics, but this one seems sort of simple and generic, a basic ale type without a ton of flavor. still, overall this beer seems high quality, fancy even, and quite unique, a mix of red and brown ale qualities in a really smooth and refined beer overall. fun stuff, i hope to see more of their stuff around! this is great at the holiday table, really festive without being spiced!Dec 23, 2017"

Coedo Beniaka,3.5,4.0,3.75,3.75,"My first Happoshu ! (I never thought I would get beyond 101 styles.) What a pleasant surprise.
And so is the beer. Perfect for lunch (which mostly was California rolls.) So, I'm having a great culinary experience.
Beniaka has a pleasant sweetness (I presume from the sweet potatoes and caramel malt) that counters the soy sauce.

Looks and Smells resemble a Belgian dubbel with the usual malty, molasses, sugar going on. Taste lacks Belgian's individualistic spicing (which is OK by me) and Feels and finishes mostly sweet with out any cloying. But it is just the overall sensation of finding a new style and an appropriate food strictly by serendipity that makes beer-hunting all that much more fun.

Coedo Beniaka,3.5,4.0,3.75,4.0,"Bottle, no visible date. DFH tulip.

A: pours a hazy dark Amber to light brown, with 1 finger off-white head that quickly recedes to a thick ring of bubbles at the edge of the glass. Only a little visible carbonation. Really interesting bottle.

S: sweet potato! Candied yams with caramelized brown sugar. This is such a Thanksgiving dessert beer. Really a bold sweet potato nose; mouthwatering.

T: drier than the nose would suggest, but still a sweet, malty, bready arrival. Mid palate is dark, toasted rye bread crust with hints of that sweet potato taste. As it transitions to the ending and finish you get a burst of earthy and sweet tubers right before a slightly astringent bittering. Earthy and slightly sweet taste lingers.

M: lighter end of mid bodied with low carbonation. A little slick initially, but turns clean and somewhat astringent on the finish. Definitely a lager. Without a doubt the cleanest and most drinkable pumpkin or yam beer I have ever had.

O: this satisfies the happoshu category, though it is no happoshu. What it is is a thoroughly enjoyable yam beer. If it weren't $6.39 a bottle, I'd make it a regular Thanksgivin tradition. As it is, it was an interesting beer and I would recommend it highly.Nov 05, 2016"
Coedo Beniaka,3.0,3.25,3.25,3.25,"""Beniaka."" Imperial sweet potato amber. 7% ABV. 

333ml brown glass bottle with sanguine label and Thai description purchased at the Beer Lab in Chiang Mai Thailand for 310 baht. Packaged 05.11.15.

Notes below are brief since I'm relegated to a phone review.

A: No head. Auburn body. No yeast is visible within.

Sm: Toasted amber malts give this a nice backbone that nods towards bread crust and Caramel. Hop character bends a bit herbal. I have to look for the sweet potato to notice it, but while I doubt I'd recognize sweet potato in a blind tasting, I do pick up on an uncommon sweetness; in any case, it really seems to work.

Aromatic intensity is average.

T: Has a raw sweetness I guess comes from sweet potato, but there's no way I'd guess that blind. Amber malts are at the core of this well-balanced brew. Marshmallow, brown sugar/pimoncello, caramel, bread crust, toast. A kiss of pumpkin.

No noticeable hop character here. No booziness or yeast character.

Nicely executed, though it lacks the depth of flavour and complexity I'd expect in any great imperial amber.

I do like it, even if there's ample room for improvement.

Mf: Smooth, medium-bodied, wet, well-carbonated, and of appropriate heft and weight on the palate.

O: Drinkable, especially for a sweet beer of 7% ABV. I'd get it again if offered at a better price. The raw sweetness imparted by the sweet potato helps set this one apart; it definitely has a different flavour profile than most imperial Ambers (which tend to go big on the hops). Interesting fare from a brewery I'd never heard of prior.

Coedo Beniaka,3.75,4.0,4.25,3.5,"0ml bottle into 350ml beer glass. Bit of a head. No lacing.

Quite a nice nose on this - little bit of coffee I think and some brown sugar. A little bit of fruit coming through with the malts.

Palate is nice also - malty with some coffee and caramel. Nice.

Mouth is a little thin and fizzy.

Overall I really enjoyed this. I think I had a bit of a taste for red ales as I'd just drunk Brew Dog's 5am red ale when I drank this. I scored that one highly and this stood up pretty well.Jun 03, 2016"
Coedo Beniaka,4.25,3.0,3.5,3.5,"Deep amber colored brew with a pale white head, poured into a nonic ten ounce glass. 4.25

Smells quite a bit like sweet potato and it’s not unpleasant. Different. Kind of nice. Also has an odd yeasty presence that reminds me of my heavy-drinking days, is kind of pungent and acrid, and also kind of reminds me of vodka. It’s pretty much the way a lot of beers smelled before I’d tasted a great beer. 3

Sweet potato makes it to my taste buds and again, I’m pleasantly surprised. Also has a quality like sake. There’s got to be rice in here. It’s got the feel and the taste. And it’s kind of caramelly and bread sweet. Some floral notes are there in the mix too. It’s interesting and not bad at all. 3.5

Okay, I do have one beef. This thing feels hot and sake-like. Seriously, there’s a sake quality to this. The mouthfeel is a bit numbing almost. Beyond that it’s sweet, kind of sticky and finishes with a bitter dryness. 3.5

This ain’t bad at all. I’d drink it again.Jun 01, 2016"
Coedo Beniaka,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,"A: Moderately clean malt with a caramel like quality, with a moderately sweet aroma. 

A: Light amber color, quite clear with a very thin white head that has adequate retention. Light lacing in the glass.

T: Moderate clean malt, with the sweet potato in the foreground. The beer is fairly sweet with moderate bitterness that slightly lingers. 

M: Medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation. The beer has almost a soft mouth-feel and drinks super easy for being 7% ABV. 

O: Alright; the aroma and flavor is reminiscent of an Amber lager with a bit more sweetness. Interesting idea to use the sweet potato to drive the light sweetness.Apr 30, 2016"

Coedo Beniaka,4.25,1.5,2.0,3.25,"A deep, reddish amber lager with sweet potato at its focus. This is the first time I've poured a beer down the drain after expecting something excellent. I've had great Japanese beer, and this is not one of them.

I am about to make a statement that may sound rude or ignorant, but I promise I am not being bigoted when I say this: this beer reeks of soy sauce. In a very bad way. It smells terrible. It makes me sick thinking about the smell. I couldn't take it, and that's coming from someone who uses soy sauce/tamari a lot with food.

The taste wasn't something to write home about either. It looked great in a glass, though!

I don't think sweet potato lagers are for me.Nov 10, 2015"

Coedo Beniaka,3.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"While this is technically a happoshu, it really has nothing particular in common with any other happoshu. Happoshu is a tax bracket, not a beer style, and this site should probably reflect that.

It's a stretch to call this beer 'amber,' although I suppose if you've got 'imperial' in front of it then you could get away with it. But really it's brown. Thick, deep, mahogany brown with a camel-colored foam that doesn't really last. Smells delicious, though, with a cavalcade of 'roasty' aromas: sweet potatoes, chestnuts, pumpkin bread, and malted milk, along with some lovely dark fruit notes as well, namely blackcurrants and chocolate-covered cherries.

Tastes less sweet than it smells, although this is still decidedly malty, and actually reminds me of a really good bock. Flavors of chocolate, dried fig, blackcurrants, dark caramel, maple, and a hint of sherry all come tied up in a gorgeously smooth and rich (but not sickly) mouthfeel. Disappointingly, it doesn't have much of a sweet potato flavor – probably the malts are just getting in the way – but that's not such a big deal when the beer is so good anyway. Very tasty stuff. Possible food pairings: baba ganoush, horumon yaki, meatballs, foie gras, Alpine cheese.Sep 05, 2015"
Coedo Beniaka,2.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,"Pours a dark brown red. Below normal head volume with little retention or lacing.

The nose is rather nice, sweet potato, molasses, light caramel and maybe other vegetables or fruit.

Light body with a texture a bit heavier than water. Below normal carbonation with just a bit of effervescence in the finish.

The flavor is unique, but not bad if you like sweet potatoes. Sweet potato becomes the base with a bit of hop bitterness arriving in the middle. As it progresses, the sweetness takes on a molasses note with a hint of caramel.Sep 03, 2015"
Coedo Beniaka,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.75,"1.25oz bottle, 2 cup Pyrex, 14.12.11 on the back label.

The color is russet, like sweet potatoes and brown sugar mashed. There isn't much head to speak of, just a collection of off-white bubbles that cover half the top. 

It's a very sweet aroma and the sweet potatoes come through, smelling like they're mixed with the aforementioned brown sugar. Alcohol is also apparent, though not harsh. 

Sweet, sugary, with an earthiness in the back. Finishes musky and bitter from the alcohol. 

Velvety, not very carbonated. 

This is a hard beer to rate. I don't know the Happoshu style well, but I believe it usually refers to beers cut largely with rice or more benign adjuncts. This is a creative iteration that is much like a Doppelbock in my eyes. Quite tasty and will go anywhere a Doppelbock will!Jul 11, 2015"
Coedo Beniaka,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.75,"The sweet potatoes are definitely the main feature here. For me, probably a bit too much. Gives a full sweetness with a mildly syrup level of feel.

Tui Blond Lager,3.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,"st Beer of a 'Random Beer Evening'.

330ml brown bottle: 3 months out of date when poured into a Duvel glass on 17 Aug 2013.

Looked fine: clear and clean, deep golden body with a full white crown of bubbles on top.

Aroma of wet cardboard with a metallic clunk to it: some sweetness too.

Grainy taste, with added sugar, not nice at all. Tried to get into it, but failed: had to open a packet of crisps to help me finish the glass off.

Worst beer I've had from New Zealand: not that I've had many.Aug 17, 2013"
Tui Blond Lager,2.75,3.0,2.75,3.0,"A 330ml bottle with a BB of March 2013. Picked up cheap from a local off-licence earlier today. Described on the label as 'triple-hopped'. The bottle neck has an internal vortex design that is presumably there to agitate the beer as you pour. The presence of such a gimmick doesn't bode well...

Poured into a straight pint glass. A clear golden-amber colour with good carbonation. Forms a diminuitive head of white foam that lasts for barely a few seconds before dissipating. Vortex notwithstanding, it looks decidedly unimpressive. Aroma of light malt with hints of sweetness and stewed leaves. A twinge of cardboard in the background. Not much going on.

Tastes of light malt with a mild finish. Notes of faint grain and weak stewed leaves. Dry, with a subtle bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth and lightly tingly, but thin and insubstantial. Reminiscent of sparkling mineral water. Aftertaste of faint malt - virtually nothing there.

No great shakes - there's not much to say about this lager. Very bland; both aroma and flavour have faint hints of malt and stewed hops. This is what the ghost of a beer must taste like. Both appearance and body are subpar. Nothing offensive about it but it leaves me cold - I like my beer to taste of something. Give it a miss.Mar 30, 2013"

Widmer Brothers Columbia Common,4.0,3.5,3.75,3.5,"I enjoyed this from the 12oz brown bottle in a teku chilled, purchased at Brass Rail bottled on Feb 3 2014.

The color is deep amber bordering on bronze with light chill haze, but thick proud head of white with very fine bead with great retention, the lace sticks in a web formation. The smell is very herbal from the hops with slight grainy odor with earthy yeast element adding a light spice ester. The feel is moderately carbonated with gentle bitterness and mild sweetness with a toasted grain texure and light hint of yeast fruitiness with semi-dry finish.

The flavor starts peppery and herbal from the hops which bring out a sort of earthy complimentary malt element with lager-like yeast flavors bringin some mineral elements along with toastiness in the malt and a light almond-like nutty sweetness with a subtle caramel or vienna flavor which compliments the yeast and adds a bit of depth. Overall I would not say this is the best example of the style, but it is better than average in most regards including drinkability...I would try this on draft.May 19, 2014"

It is a handsome looking mahogany amber pour with a modest off-white head that settles back shortly into a ring.

The aroma emits roasted caramel malts and perhaps some butterscotch but little in the way of hops. They must be well integrated into the mix.

Light to medium body and smooth.

The rich roasted caramel malts play up a bit more in the taste and the bitterness is must by it finishes clean and balanced. Not sure how often I would have this. Not a ""go out of my way to get it"" kind of beer.May 03, 2014"
Widmer Brothers Columbia Common,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Need to switch up from IPAs for the moment, so a Common/Steam should do nicely.

Pours a small fizzy airy bubbly head covering, kinda pathetic head actually, fades at a med pace, what's actually there of it that is, touches of lacing, very clear iced-tea brown colored.

Nose brings some typical steam beer aromas, smooth soft malty note, a little mineral water and herbal tea, actually quite a bit of tea and more like iced tea, hint of grainy, mild caramely note too.

Taste brings malts at first, a strange malt character though, it does have the mild grainy toasty with soft steam beer notes, but also sweeteners without much sweetness, caramel, toffee, touch of candy crunch nutty sugar daddy like, then that weird iced tea flavor again, just like a strong Lipton iced tea and herbal as well, with mild grassy herbal hop kick on the back end. Soft minerals and crisp lager like notes although it's listed as a ""spring ale"". Finish is soft and a bit crisp, mildly sticky but dry still, bit more iced tea, mild herbal hop bitterness, bit more of the soft minerals but also caramel and more candy without the sweetness.

Mouth is lighter bod, soft, decent carb.

Overall OK, but nothing too special, it has the nice soft feel, soft minerals, that iced tea is really different, and the candy notes are also off for a steam beer, but an interesting twist on it. I wouldn't say I didn't enjoy this a bit, it was a pretty good beer, just not what I expected.Apr 28, 2014"
Widmer Brothers Columbia Common,4.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,"Appearance on this beer is extremely clear and crisp. I wish this beer was as satisfying as its looks. Head was light and barely present even directly after pour. Color resided somewhere inbetween a light to medium amber hue. 

Smell gave off a slight sour note, with lots of malt. The main components I picked out were an aromatic, or biscuit malt attached with a wandering earthy stench, this was mainly experienced when smelling, not while drinking.

Taste was about as boring as a newcastle that has been sitting out in the fridge for a few weeks. The beer was carbonated properly and extremely fresh, but there was just absolutely nothing redeeming about the taste of this beer. When taking a sip, the bitterness of the malt and hops are paired extremely well, only to be let down with the faint taste of acidity and absolutely no lingering aroma of hops. 

The mouthfeel of this beer was light, and barely present. I struggled to not drink this beer extremely quickly as it went down like a glass of carbonated spring water. 

Overall for 3.25 a pint, I don't feel let down, but I will not be trying this beer again unless it is in a bottle and it is free.Apr 15, 2014"
Widmer Brothers Columbia Common,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Appearance- Pours up a decent amount of head which has pretty good retention. The head is pure, cotton-white while the body is a medium amber that appears as a pale to medium amber when held up to the light. Fair amount of lacing. 

Nose- Fairly subtle. Light notes of biscuit, faint hints of pine and resin. Some fruitiness around the edges that resembles white grape but nothing very conspicuous. Swirling shows a woody note from the hops and a little more grain. 

Taste- Starts off with a good amount of malt that ranges from biscuit to grain to cornflakes. Slight woody bitterness from the hops on the finish. Slight fruit esters but nothing pronounced, just as with the nose. Seems like a good representation of the style but that style is a tad boring. Some pine and resin, even a hint of spice, black pepper. Definitely more assertive that I would expect a 3 month old beer to be. I would place it as above average because it is a rather simplistic beer. Some citrus (orange and lemon) start to come out as it opens up. Some hints toward being a solid, good beer. 

Mouthfeel- Light to medium bodied with not a lot of carbonation. Some dryness on the finish. 

Drinkability- Pretty easygoing and quite sessionable. Gets a little boring but is Widmer's standard cheap price. Probably wouldn't buy this again though. 

Overall- Above average beer that has glimmers of being good. Worth a try, especially if you want another example of the style.Feb 24, 2014"

T- Up front the fruity esters (again strawberry) dominate with a woody, herbal, minty hop balance in the middle and a slightly sweet toffee/taffy sweet finish.

M- Light body with low carbonation that gives some similarities to an English bitter and makes for a very mouth filling beer.

O- I liked this one a lot. Not dominated by any single characteristic but the herbal hops are balanced well by everything else going on. Seems to have held up even greater than 4 months after bottling.Oct 22, 2013"

A – Pours a mostly clear russet copper, a small fleeting white head settles into a thin cap.

S – Sweet grain, tangy wheat, cooked corn, slightly toasted, 

T – Sweet toasted grains, light orange notes, dull grassiness, multi-grain cereal, sweet biscuit malts, the yeast is more powdery than bready.

M – Stingy carbonation adds some bite on the tip of the tongue, body is full but light around the edges, very light toasted caramel character comes out with some peppery bitterness on the finish. Grassiness only seems to come out on the aftertaste, along with notions of tart fruit skin which is kind of odd.

A quick drinker. Wish this was a little fresher, seems to have faded a bit. Dull components make for an unmemorable beer but some bitterness keeps it alive. An average cream ale that doesn’t stand out in it’s class.Jun 20, 2013"

Widmer Brothers Columbia Common,4.5,4.0,4.25,4.0,"I plucked this from the cooler at the Knickerbocker Hotel last weekend, a story in and of itself. That said, this is the Bros.' Spring Ale, following closely on the heels of Penn Brewery's Winter Ale. What day/season is it today? I have no idea after sitting through a bone-chilling baseball game yesterday.

I know/understand the style and I am not going to even touch the in-fighting of some of the previous reviews. Please, look at the style descriptor(s) and do some reading before launching into one another.

I went with a fairly aggro pour which resulted in a surprisingly brief finger of light-tan head with relatively low retention. It is a cool day and there is little to no humidity and the lack of head retention was surprising. Color was a deep-copper with NE-quality clarity and if there was a way to cash it in at my local recycling center, I would be on my way there now. I had a babe of a g/f in the early 1990's and her hair was both copper-colored and coarse as wire. I wonder if she braids it up and sells it as scrap? Man, what a beauty! Both the g/f and the beer. Nose was solidly malty with a slightly minty/grassy scent underneath. I was vaguely reminded of Girl Scout mint cookies. Taste was semi-sweet and quite tasty. It occurred to me, in writing this review, that I have never reviewed Anchor Steam, despite it being one of the first micros I ever put up to my lips, I wonder how the two will compare. This was worthwhile.May 25, 2013"
Widmer Brothers Columbia Common,3.0,2.75,2.75,2.75,"Good name for this one. Not a bad beer, well above the adjunct axis of evil - you know who I mean. But in the current craft environment, this just blends in. It's even on the label - common.
The look is of any spring ale, maibock, pilsner, etc., which is to say medium to dark, but as I like to say, you don't drink the look.
Smell and taste are indistinct, this beer does not want to stand out. I won't call it lazy, but it certainly is not working very hard. I'm not asking them to put cherry blossoms or grass nibs in the fermentation - I don't need a beer to be so exotic, but a range of flavors would be nice. There is a mild hint of grass, citrus or pine, but not much. More malt than hops, in fact very little hop aroma or flavor at all.
Widmer is in the Redhook Kona Pyramid family of beers and they are starting to seem like the GM of beers to me. Decent, working vehicles, some really good, but there's a whole lot of overlap between them leaving you to wonder, if there wasn't a label on the bottle, could you tell the difference?

Pretty much tastes the same as it smells. Light hop flavors/aroma. Tastes close to a bitter for some reason.

Widmer Brothers Columbia Common,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Served on tap in a pint glass

Appearance – The beer is served a clear amber color with a one finger off white head that has a moderate level of persistence. The head fades after a few minutes of time to leave a lighter level of lace on the sides of the glass.

Smell – The aroma is a mix of a more grainy smells with some lighter roasted malt and bready smells. With these aromas are some lighter notes of a more citrus and floral hop smell mixed with the lightest amount of a caramel sweetness.

Taste – The taste begins with a more bready flavor mixed with some caramel sweetness. There is a little bit of a roasted malt flavors more toward the middle of the taste along with some hop of a more grapefruit citrus variety. At the end, more hop flavors come to the tongue, this time of a more grassy flavor, which in the end leave a lightly hopped and crisper malty flavor to be left on the tongue.

Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the medium to slightly thinner side with a carbonation level that is on the higher side. Both are rather nice for making a crisp and rather easy drinking brew as this one is meant to be.

Overall – While not a flavorful powerhouse, it does have a nice easy drinking and refreshing taste with just enough complexity to not be boring, but not too much too take away from its more session like (at 4.7 % abv) and easy drinking qualities.Apr 12, 2013"
Widmer Brothers Columbia Common,3.5,3.5,3.75,4.0,"Appearance - Pours a clear, dark golden amber with an off-white, finger width head. Fair retention. Leaves a broken layer of microbubbles on the surface, while lacing is spotty at best.

Smell - Lightly toasted bread, hints of caramel, light pepper, subdued hops coming across as floral.

Taste - Strong overtones of caramel sweetness met by an addition of toasted bread, touches of honey and moderate grass hop character . Bittersweet finish. 

Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Nice bite. Goes down with near buttery smoothness.

Overall - Nice take on the style, though I'm not big on the style to begin with. Much like the Ninkasi Spring Reign I had last night, this does well as a spring seasonal release. Easy drinker. Downright sessionable.Apr 06, 2013"

The taste holds notes of mild biscuit, greens, light grass, flowers, and a twinge of nougat (yeah, I'm not sure where that came from, either).

Camden Hells Lager,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,"Look: Pale Straw with a lot of visible carbonation, decent white one finger head that does not last.
Smell: not a very strongly fragrant beer, but it does smell malty and slightly citrusy.
Taste: the sweet malt definitely helps bring forward the hints of lemon and general citrus vibes I have from this beer.
Feel: pretty light mouthfeel, properly carbonated though for the style.
Overall: its an alright lager, but by no means is it exceptional. Nice to see it in the pubs though rather than Peroni or Bud Light.Oct 29, 2020"
Camden Hells Lager,2.75,3.0,3.0,3.0,"Golden dark slightly murky colour, not like the helles I know. Small but persistent head with good lacing. Smell of hay, some grass and skunk. It's like a helles with a tiny bit of oomph. It is quite sweet and has some metallic off notes. Tried since before and after the takeover and to my mind it's definitely not as good now. Review based on post takeover. Not a beer worth seeking out.Jul 07, 2020"

Appearance
Pours to a two finger cap of foam that is slightly rocky and nearly permanent. Straw gold yellow, clear

Aroma
Clean, slightly sweet-smelling pilsner malt, mild grassy, herbal hop.

Flavor
Malt forward for sure. Strong, clean, crisp, ftrsh tasting pale malts balanced by a soft noble hop flavor and alpha acids. Balanced finish.

Mouthfeel
Light to medium, nominal co2 and a slight tannic roughness

Overall
Easy drinking, polished helles from a UK brewer. Hits the spot. Nuanced malt for maltheads. Keeper.Jul 29, 2019"

Camden Hells Lager,3.75,2.0,1.0,1.5,"Third or fourth time I have had this beer. Nice and bright on the eye, a bit too foamy in the mouth to get stuck into. Surprisingly little flavour for the strength. Hops are well mashed, malt is clean and unremarkable. Comparable to some of the better traditional domestic lagers, e.g. Schiehallion. Very, very generic lager. I would always seek out something nearer the 5% mark for a more authentic European lager experience.Nov 30, 2018"
Camden Hells Lager,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.5,"Review from notes. 330 ml bottle served cold into a pint glass. Purchased and enjoyed while on vacation in the UK.

Appearance - Clear, pale golden color. Half finger of short lasting white head. Spotty lacing at best.

Smell - Clean aromas, grainy with a subtle offputting metallic note. A subtle bit of ash too. But mostly grainy.

Taste - Clean with corn sweetness and chalkier flavor as compared with many in the style. For some reason I liked it.

Mouthfeel - Clean and simple. good carbonation and light body. Not sense of chalkiness here.

Overall - A decent and middling Munich Helles lager.Aug 01, 2017"
Camden Hells Lager,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"330ml can sered from the fridge into beer mug. Light straw colour, heavy carbonation. 1cm white head is retained. Looks good.

Mild hop bitterness, very clean tasting. Tastes like a very well made helles. 

Definitely more of a helles than a pilsner in my opinion. The packaging states that this is a hybrid of both styles.

Super.Jul 18, 2017"
Camden Hells Lager,3.0,3.75,2.75,3.0,"The colour is straw yellow, the liquid is clear. The two finger head is white and compact; it sinks down to a thin lid leaving no lacing.

The smell is stronger than expected with notes of farmhouse bread, dough, grains and dried flowers. Plus, a touch of wet paint.

The taste is mild and smooth with a fine clean bitterness, some fresh bread and floral notes. Light to medium body. The rather thin aftertaste got growing notes of pilsner malt, flowers and a touch of sweet dough. Toffee and bran in the short finish.

The carbonation is medium strong, the many mid-sized bubbles mild and long-lived. The liquid is semi-smooth. 

A mild and clean beer with some unclean alcohol in the aftertaste. Almost bland.Mar 10, 2017"
Camden Hells Lager,3.25,3.25,3.25,3.0,"More Pils than Helles, more carbonated grassy malt water than Pils.

Camden Hells Lager,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.25,"From 330ml can.

Dark gold, clear, with light carbonation (difficult to tell through the attractive condensation on the glass). Thin, foamy head with plenty of lacing. Looks like a pale lager, basically.

Smells of pilsner malt. Has a soft lemony note.

Medium sweet. A little bit of lemon rind. Sharp and clean tasting. Some minerality.

Mouthfeel is a little thin. Saved by some carbonation. Has a decent dry, bitter finish.

Overall, tastes like a premium version of a mass-produced European lager. Not bad (better than Meantime's London Lager) but nor is it a stand-out for me. ABV has been reduced slightly to 4.6%.Dec 30, 2015"
Camden Hells Lager,3.25,3.25,3.25,4.0,"On tap, poured into a sampler. The aroma, initially, has a light acetone note to it, but this is soon replaced by grains and pastry dough with undertones of mineral water and spice. The pour is a brilliant and oily clear light straw hue with an effervescent quality and a white, dense, dirty head that has mild retention and light lace. The taste is a medium light, near balanced, bittersweet. The texture is thin but oily with a slickness and a mild zippy carbonation. The light body is composed of flavors of citrus peel, spice, minerals, and banana bread. The finish is mostly citrus peel with a spice and the aftertaste is mostly clean with bitter lemon and mineral water.Sep 14, 2015"
Camden Hells Lager,3.25,3.25,3.0,3.25,"Appearance - Crisp, clear, streaming, golden body with a big white foam head that has good retention.

Smell - Crisp kilned malts dominate the aroma profile of this beer giving it a straight up lager like aroma. There is good hop nip in the aroma here and over all good balance.

Taste - Bitter hoppy front which is well balanced by the mild malty middle to this one. The malt sweetness is mild but constant and again provides a good lager like flavour.

Mouth feel - Decent body to this beer and has a light astringency that leads into t cloying end.

Overall - Another well balanced beer that although not as good as some from the brewery is still a very fine beer.Jun 22, 2015"
Camden Hells Lager,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Many thanks to Gavin for the bottle.

Pours a slightly hazed, pale yellow color, with a beautiful, froth head.

Offers an intense, dank grassiness, accompanied by soft, bready malts. Underneath, a layer of white lemon peel becomes detectable, adding to the clean and intriguing nose. The malts develop a certain sweetness while the beer warms up, accentuating the prickly lemon as its counterpart.

Has a higher, lively carbonation, showcasing the beers light and refreshing character, while displaying a certain softness, due to the malts. 

Tastes of cakey malts, building the foundation of the beer, which blends into flowery, fruit topped hops, adding to the initial flavor profile. The sappy fruits, as well as the biscuity qualities vanish almost completely, as the hops turn bitter, triggered by the slightly metallic carbonation. Needs a short glance to adjust the palate actually, as the beer takes a huge turn, changing its flavor direction. Hops bring back the grass from the nose, together with lemon and wet earth, revealing a note of fudge during the finish, as well as a refreshing, long lasting dryness.

Offers up a fantastic variety of flavors, which turn out great, producing a convincing taste mixture, featuring an almost undoable twist.Jun 12, 2015"

A: The beer is crystal clear light yellow in color and has a light amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a half finger high bright white head.
S: Light to moderate aromas of malts are perceptible in the nose and slight bits of corn seem to be detectable.
T: Similar to the smell, the taste is rather malty and seems to be a little sweet. Once again, hints of corn seem to shine through among the malts.
M: It feels light-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation.

Camden Hells Lager,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.25,"330ml Bottle (4.6% ABV): BBD 12 Feb 14, poured into a Veltins badged stemmed tulip on 13 Nov 13 during a random lager/pilsner tasting session with the wife.

Looked fine, pale golden with a white crown, unlike most beers of this style the head hung around and gave some lacing, so I was pleased with that.

The nose was light, grainy and slightly floral with a mild sweetness.

The taste was also light and delicate: more hop bitterness than malty sweetness but both could be found in the flavours. Citrus notes as it warmed a little, which I didn't take too, but otherwise a good brew and it scored a lot better than some we shared that night.Nov 17, 2013"

A: pours a clear, pale straw colour, coming with a thin but well lasting white foamy head, on top of rather moderate carbonation.
S: light savoury notes accompany the dusty, herbal and floral German hop aroma, against a background of very light grainy malts with just a whiff of doughy acidity. Smells like a classic Helles bier in a bottle, at best.
T: a lightly sweet, clean grainy maltiness paves the way for the lightly spicy and herbal hop flavour and bitterness to follow, finishing clean and crisp, but the acidity seems to dissipate altogether from the palate.
M&O: clean and lightly carbonated, the light body goes well with the moderate flavour profile, although all in all the flavour doesn’t seem to render enough weight or impact to be an interesting session beer.Oct 26, 2013"
Oettinger Hefeweissbier,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A: The beer is a bit hazy yellow in color and has a moderate to high amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a half finger high white head that died down but consistently left a short head covering the surface.
S: Moderate aromas of banana-like yeast are present in the nose along with hints of spices.
T: The taste follows the smell, except that the spicy flavors of the yeast are a tad bit stronger.
M: It feels light- to medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This hefeweizen is a fairly good representation of the style.

Oettinger Hefeweissbier,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.25,"L- Mid-golden, slightly hazy, pours with nice looking 1Cm white head (ps. holds well).
S- Mild weissen notes.
T- The weissen notes are more prominent on the palate, ie there is no doubting the style here. It's a touch more sweet/less hoppy-dry than I'm used to from the style.
F- Carbonation in the mouth is very good, but the overall feel seems a bit under-powered. Perhaps the Feel also suffers simply relative to the prominent taste and lively carbonation?
O- It's pleasant enough as a regular tipple, but I can't see it wowing many fans of weissen. I'd be interested in how it would be if it were in a say 5.4% version...? Meanwhile there are so many other better weissens I see no reason why I'd buy this one again.

S:
Big clove, caramel, bubblegum and banana are heads up also big bready malt and citrus zest in late participation. 

T:
The taste is well balance in mingling wheat malt, barley malt and hop. Yeasts also play well by yielding big clove touch in the lead along with banana, spice, bubblegum and citrus. Bitterness is left there by hop with a ghost-like quality.

M:
Feel is rich, crisp, smooth and refreshing generating by firm carbonation within its medium body, very dry finish.

Smells of straight up grapefruit juice.

Tastes like grapefruit juice and grapefruit peel upfront, which dominates throughout the sip. In the middle and near the finish you get a hint of twangy wheat, white cracker, hay, and a touch of clove; then a clean finish. Leans slightly sweet with a bit of grapefruity sourness.

It looks fluorescent orange; inspecting the label, I saw that color has been added (why)?! It smells and tastes like cheap juice concentrate, cloyingly sweet and artificial tasting. The only indication of any beer in there was the carbonation. One of the reviews here mentions that it resembles and alcopop, which is accurate. My friend also commented that it took her back to her underage drinking days, but now that we're both grown-ups, we prefer our beer to taste like beer.Jan 26, 2020"
Schofferhofer Grapefruit Hefeweizen,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,"Best by 10/1/20

Pours a golden orange with a fluffy white head that fades slowly

Aroma is mostly grapefruit, real juicy and authentic, some spice from the yeast and a light wheat backbone

Taste is more of the same, the grapefruit comes up front, mid palate has a lemony tartness that fades into the smooth wheat, but almost feels dumbed down by the wheat, this probably should’ve been a straight up fruit beer instead of a hefe

Feel is about as light as you’d expect for this radler type mix, I just wish it was a little more carbonated. Leaves a bit of a film after the swallow

At the very least, this is passable and refreshing, but I would probably only drink it again in the context of a hot summer dayJan 01, 2020"

L: cloudy-ass, pink grapefruit colored liquid; off-white foam sizzles out as quickly as it builds, but a messy cap/collar sticks for a bit

S: can't tell if it's skunk, grapefruit, or both on the nose - the fruit masks it up close, but a forearm's length away, I don't know... at any rate, I love grapefruit, this doesn't smell like a weizen at all, but I'll be nice

T: all shandy up front, but the malt/wheat and earthy yeast make themselves just before the end of the finish, and do somehow stand slightly above the grapefruit in the aftertaste... by the second sip, the grapefruit essence pervades; no overt banana, clove, or other textbook weizen flavors clearly audible; all in all, rather tasty though

F: basically unfiltered juice with a subtle beefin' up of body by wheat... barely any discernible alcohol, if any at all

O: why oh why is this in the hefeweizen category? - you got Summer Shandy in the 'fruit and field' camp, just do right by this and shove this over there too, and I'll return to bump up me marks yo; a lovely drink (1542)Oct 04, 2019"

Taste: It has some characteristics of a Hefeweizen, wheat a hint of the yeast, a hint of

S: Tart side of tangy with aromas of pink grapefruit, navel orange, banana, and red berries. Needless to say, really fruity.
T: Sweet and lightly tart. The palate follows the nose with a gestalt feel of Mimosa versus fruit juice blend. No appreciable bitter quality.
M: Light to medium bodied with no more than moderate carbonation.
O: Had it with brunch at at Bier Garten and it was perfect for that. Drinks like a fruit smoothie: absolutely delicious. Ausgezeichnet!

Looks like a mix of pink grpefruit and orange juice. Little carnoation creates a fluffy head that dissipates quickly.

Smells like atificail grapefruit. Like a bad fizzy grapefruity drink.

Kapuziner Weissbier,4.0,3.25,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a 16.9 oz. can. Has a copper/orange color with a 1 inch head. Smell is mild, bananas, pink bubble gum.

Kapuziner Weissbier,4.0,4.25,4.0,4.0,"Poured from a pint can into a weizen glass.

Pours a hazy deep gold (but not amber) with an excellent two-fingered head that is a little more creamy than rocky, and that's fine. It lingers well and gives way to excellent lacing. Pretty in the glass for sure. 

Excellent aromas of banana, clove, white grape, granny smith apple, mild yeast, faint grassy hops.

Sweet on the tip of the tongue, with bubblegum and banana, but spicy yeast quickly joins in midstream, along with cloves and allspice. Tart wheat offsets the sweetness quite well, manifesting in mild citrus and tart apple. Very substle hops. The finish is almost warming in spice, with a bit of warmth lingering on the lips. Very well balanced between the mild sweetness and the complex tartness. 

A little creamier than anticipated, the brew is more of a smooth finisher than a lively crisp one, but it's still drying, if not crisp, owing to some sneaky carbonation. 

There are others of the style that are better, but this one is unique yet hews closely to the hallmarks of the style. The creamy finish and warming spice make it a treat.Oct 03, 2020"
Kapuziner Weissbier,4.0,3.75,3.5,3.5,"L- Deep amber, slightly cloudy, pours with 2mm white head (holds well).
S- Notably fruity, for a moment I'm reminded of the boiled sweets called 'Pear Drops' and bananas.
T- The Smell^ carries over, a rounded fruit note, hints of banana, then a hoppy dry note veers in, and into a dry/CO2 note at the finish. < Those are the distinctive taste notes, on top of the more generic weissbier characteristics.
F- Certainly a 2-in-1 here, at first it starts off on the richer side, then swiftly flips to hoppy/dry+CO2. This happens on each of my first several mouthfuls. 
O- A Weissbier profile but with distinctly prominent fruit/banana notes - I am sure you could ID this from a random line up of 10 or even 20 world beers/styles without *any* problem. Whether that works for you is another matter. I've enjoyed trying it but the banana note might get a bit worn out after say one more, and IMO it's too different/distinctive to be sessionable. Certainly something different though!

Kapuziner Weissbier,3.75,4.0,4.25,4.0,"Look: Orange leaning to amber in color, cloudy/murky, and the pour brings on a good head that recedes quickly leaving great lacing
Aroma: Clove, wheat bread, and banana intermixed. Some fruity esters emerge as well
Taste: Huge clove up front, then in floods a combo of warm wheat bread and banana – like a wheat-based banana bread. Some bubblegum comes and goes as well
Mouthfeel: Big and chewy but not overwhelming on the palate. Light to medium carbonation and a super soft finish
Overall: I’m digging this one. The huge amounts of flavor that the yeast brings just screams Weissbier (as opposed to a more approachable ‘wheat ale’) and that is exactly what I wanted when I grabbed this one. Tasty stuff and a great warm weather companionJul 08, 2020"

Kapuziner Weissbier,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Draft, served in branded 0.5l Weizen glass. 

It’s beautiful and hard to imagine a more stylistically perfect appearance than this hazed medium gold beer. The bubble artistry is probably the real attraction in its fluffy, shade of white, cloud-like Head. It only suffers in a surprising light lace.

Chalky, banana, hint of clove, and not overpowering in any way.

More spot on banana and clove flavors both complete the style picture and blend seamlessly with a robust bitterness. This beer is regulated so well from the esters to the level of sweetness.

It has what I call a matte mouthfeel; a combination of yeast and bitterness that lays on the tongue and sometimes on your teeth. Carbonation battles this well and again achieves balance, leaving no objectionable aftertaste.

This is a very good Hefeweizen.Jun 21, 2018"

SMELL: Bolder nose of wheat malt, clove, bubble gum and light citrus aromas. Hints of bread as well. Nice stuff. 

TASTE: Wheat, clove and bready flavors with a decent punch of bubble gum at the swallow. Bold finish of wheat malt, bready flavors, clove spices, bubble gum and light citrus flavors linger on the palate. Good stuff. 

PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. Creamy on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes a touch dry.

L: turbid gold with plenty of amber, dark for a hefe, with a massive rush of foam that fills the top bulb of the glass quickly; much clearer than it seemed at first and showing all kinds of activity in the glass, hundreds of bubbles grouping then gathering speed and flying up the column to create a thick 1/4- to 1/3-inch skin of offwhite/beige foam, some sticking ... the foam on this thing is incredible; an easy 5

S: sour grain, sour banana ... has a slight tartness to it; rust, dust; sweetens as it warms; definitely a ""sour"" note in this one, very odd ... it's the second bottle I've tried, and the first bottle gave off nothing but sweet notes, like a caramel-dipped banana; this one doesn't have that same sweetness; as it warms, more of the sweet malt shows up

T: lots of banana with a slight toasted malt aftertaste; some grain; a little spice, clove; the toasted flavor grows as we go, but it's still subtle

F: crisp at first, becomes silkier as you go; the carbonation releases so fast and strongly that you drink through a skin early, softening it a bit; solid midweight

O: great hefe ... even the bit of sourness in the nose can't ruin what's been two fantastic pints of this beer separated by about a week; the first pint definitely had a better aroma, lots of caramel sweetness around the banana; the pour is amazing, and the head it pushes up is impressive; the occasional toasted notes are nice ... at times, it's a bit like a graham cracker/banana treat; a great beer I'll be seeking out againJan 20, 2016"

Because this lemon taste doesn’t have a rough bitter bite, it’s as though you are having a nice lemon cake! This beer tastes just like the Sudwerks Hefeweizen from Davis, California, only filtered as a Weissbier and is more yeasty and bready, and the later parts are good thing! For those into Hefeweizens, I highly recommend Karl Strauss’ Hefeweizen and La Cumbre’s A Slice of Hefen!Oct 30, 2015"
Kapuziner Weissbier,4.75,4.25,4.5,5.0,"Saw this in the store for 8 euros for a 5L keg. Label looked like some serious work went into it (fancy gold lettering and all that jazz) so I looked it up on here. Really great ratings on here, and the price was right so I decided to give it a try despite not being the hugest fan of weissbier. 

Filled a wine glass halfway. I'm not sure if it's that it's in a keg or if it's the brand of beer, but there was tons of foam. Basically the entire glass was foam. Let it sit and it mellowed revealing a beautiful golden hue. Translucent but not to the point where you could see something on the other side of the glass. 

I'm really surprised by the flavor of this. I was expecting something hardly different from other popular weissbiers but it's really got a unique flavor. There's an underlying richness that brings to mind flavors that are more subtle in other weissbier. The thing I am really enjoying about it is the lack of the overwhelming sweetness that I usually identify with weissbier/hefe. It's really quite a welcome difference.

The overall flavor of this beer is hard to describe. The carbonation is proper; the beer is incredibly smooth. I can barely detect any hops, which is not exactly a plus for me, but I'm not honestly that upset about it. It's about as easy to drink as water, and that's not an exaggeration. I would describe the texture as very silky. You can actually taste some faint flavor from the alcohol, which actually seems to enhance the rich flavors in the beer.

Weissbier is far from my favorite style of beer, but this is easily the best one I've had. I have no complaints and could see myself drinking a lot of this in the future. Strongly recommended.Sep 12, 2015"

Taste: and really awkward here. An earth fug dominates, without much to break it or back it up. Awkward would be the word.

Aftertaste: really nothing special at all, quite awkward. Why is Monteith's so hit and miss??

Mouth feel: moderate in body with a moderate carbonation. Quite dry on the finish also.

S: Smells positively Belgian, in fact it smells like dry figs and raisins, like a quad. A bit of vomit in there too.

T: Dry, easy on the carbonation. Light but apt bitterness. The bottle describes a chocolate malt flavour, and I think it has that but it's fruity more than anything, like berries of sorts, but not too pronounced. Tiny bit of butter scotch. A bit of cardboard as well. Oh, some nice lemon in the aftertaste.

O: I like it a lot. Like the Australian Coopers pale ale, it has a distinct Belgian quality. It'd go down very well with a ploughman's in a pub at lunchtime. I live in South Korea and beggars can't be choosers here, and finding this in the supermarket was a treat.Sep 16, 2012"

Monteith's Celtic Red,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Montieths are a bit of a legend here in New Zealand, and have a fanatical following amongst the faithful. Personally, I find their beers a cut above most of the macro style beers, but not stunning. Good, certainly - but not stunning. 

That said, their Celtic Red is surprisingly drinkable. There is a synergy that comes from good appearance, fair smell and taste. The whole is certainly greater than the sum of the parts.

This beer responds well to a good chilling (yes, I know that that kills some of the flavour) and is the sort of beer you should consider when having a few friends around for a couple of drinks, or with food - especially on a hot day.

This beer complements pasta dishes quite well (I am eating and drinking as I type this), and it is also certainly a beer you can just tip your head back and enjoy.

Colour and appearance have been addressed very ably by other reviewers, so I will just say that the reddish brown fluid looks good in a glass and the smell is quite acceptable. 

Mouthfeel is good, but again, not stunning. 

OK - I grew up on beers like this (you should meet my mum...), and I can see what Monteiths were trying to achieve with this (I think), and overall, I think they did a reasonable job. Kiwi beers *aren't* amazing by world standards, but this is one of the better ones. 

If you get the chance, give it a try. Just don't expect to hear angels singing...

Oh yes, and one minor gripe about the packaging. It is the 21st century for crying out loud! It should be possible to create a twist top cap for this stuff! It is a long way to the bottle opener...

The colour was good, a traditional ruby red with a decent head fading away. Their was a little more carbonation than I really like in an ale but I've come to expect that from southern hemisphere offerings.
Quite smooth and very drinkable. The label talked of it being kilned and so I was expecting more of the malty flavour to come through.

Monteith's Celtic Red,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,"this beer is a fair effort from monteiths, but just doesnt quite hit the mark, particularly compared to the truly great irish/celtic red ales.

fantastic ruby red color, with a nice solid head. the nose is slightly malty, with a hint of fruitiness. very smooth drinking, and the flavor is a nice biscuity type, but lacking in the robustness necessary for a red ale. i always think red ales need a dryish finish, but this just finishes a tad too sweet for my liking. its smooth, a all new zealand beers are, but id like just a bit more bite on the back palate. and well, if ever pride of ringwood were needed to add a bt of character, its here. i think theyve been a bit restrained in thier application.

ive had a few sessions on this and the drinkability is good, but i like to be challenged by this style, and it just doesnt quite cut the mustard in that department. a bit better than average, but as with a others in the monteiths range, i cant help but feel they could do a lot more with this.Oct 16, 2003"

Widmer Brothers Okto Festival Ale,3.75,2.5,3.5,3.75,"My first beer in Support of New Beer Sunday (Week 573) will be another from the Bottle Backlog here at Chez Woody. I am actually starting to make real, noticeable progress; bottles are getting recycled; caps are being saved for art projects; 4- & 6-pack carriers are being emptied & returned. It is a glorious time!

From the bottle: ""Loosen your lederhosen. Our full-bodied Okto Festival Ale is inspired by Bavarian Oktoberfest. [undersigned] Kurt [&] Rob""; ""We pay fitting tribute with its distinctive malt flavors, mild floral character and crisp, clean finish. Prost! to the land of Prost!""

A Pop! of the cap & the Festival was underway! I utilized a gentle pour in deference to its relative age and then gave it a vigorous swirl in the glass. This produced a finger of foamy, tawny head with decent retention that slowly fell to wisps. Color was Deep Amber/Light Copper to Copper (SRM = > 13, < 17) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was oddly vegetal, like cooked cabbage, underlain by a biscuit maltiness. I read the style description for an Altbier, but even with the style's quirks and oddities, this does not seem right. Mouthfeel was medium to-full, not quite creamy. The taste was MUCH better than the nose had led me to expect! It was actually quite sweet, very much of caramel or crème brulee. Again, I am not sure that such is stylistically correct, nor would I ever mistake this for an Oktoberfest/Marzen. The sweetness made it more like a dessert beer for me. It was drinkable, certainly, and the finish was only semi-sweet, perhaps as a testament to the yeast having thoroughly done its job. The caramel flavor lingered well after the finish. For me, one was plenty.Feb 14, 2016"

Mouthfeel- Medium in body with medium carbonation as well. Smooth.

Widmer Brothers Okto Festival Ale,2.75,2.0,1.75,2.0,"Thanks, Dan. Strange that this is listed as an altbier. I suppose I should have poured into a stange glass, but whatever. Poured into a pint glass out of a 12oz bottle. Bottling date is listed as ""08/12/13.""

Pours an amber copper color with a very modest, off-white head that seems to settle as soon as I pour it into the glass. Amazingly, in spite of its fizzy consistency, it remains as a light right around the glass, thanks to the enormous amount of bubbles and carbonation that make themselves visible as they rise to the top. Leaves no stickiness, and lacing is pretty much inexistent. No idea how to rate this to style, but I'm sure it could look better.

The aroma reveals some caramel, toffee, light pine, grass... And that's about it. There's a brief green apple and acetone aroma that rises at the finish and coats the graininess and sweetness from the caramel, which is unpleasant. There's also some undeniable squash flavors lurking beneath. What's up with these flavors? They're strangely appealing (as in, begging to be paired with holiday related food), but it's kind of a jumbled mess. Quite poor, especially by this brewery's standards.

The flavor is brief venture into the caramel/toffee territory that it was going towards, and then in come the veggie notes. Squash, pumpkin, and cabbage permeate, with some light melon notes and acrid grassiness from the hops. Apparently this wasn't brewed with any adjuncts, but at this point, why didn't they just rebrand it as a ""pumpkin beer"" in light of the issue? Tastes stale and anemic, especially with the raspy grainy flavor and faded hop profile. Also, I can't help but notice this diacetyl texture that continues to waft its way through with each additional sip, which made this buttery, funky, and simply wrong.

Horrible stuff - I realize this is an older bottle but it should have held up better than this. Alas, I'm reviewing this because I feel that even in its freshest stages does it retain these off flavors throughout. Am I crazy, or did I get a bad bottle or something? Not anything I'd want to revist again - and I could definitely say the same for most of Widmer's beers at this point.Nov 30, 2013"

Widmer Brothers Okto Festival Ale,3.5,2.75,3.5,3.25,"12 oz bottle, poured into a pint glass

Appearance: Pours a cloudy, orange/amber color with a quarter of a finger of white head, speckled with orange highlights, which quickly dissolved into a thin lacing of foam that completely covered the top of the beer.

Aroma: Not much in the aroma department. Faint hits of malt and brown sugar. Some subtle hops aroma too.

Taste: Malty upfront, like freshly baked baguettes, followed by some brown sugar/caramel-like sweetness, finished by some nicely balanced hoppy bitterness. There’s a long finish to this beer too.

Mouthfeel: Medium, with some good carbonation to tickle the taste buds. With an ABV of 5.3%, there is no presence of alcohol on the palate.

Overall: Pretty good American version of an Oktober fest beer, and a little surprising coming from Widmer Bros., who’s beers tend to be much hoppier than this, too hoppy for my taste. This one is very well balanced and tasty.Oct 30, 2013"

Whistler Paradise Valley Grapefruit Ale,3.75,4.0,3.25,3.75,"This beer had a thin white head. The colour of the beer was a cloudy light copper - almost dirty orange looking.

The smell was phenomenal: grapefruit was quite strong, as it should be in a grapefruit ale.

Mouthfeel was prickly and light.

But the beer falls short in flavour. There is a grapefruit note for sure, but no tartness, which is a real let down, in my opinion.

Finish is kind of dry and bland. 

Decent but there are far better offerings available in the style. If they could pump up the flavour I think it would be a real winner.

Whistler Paradise Valley Grapefruit Ale,3.5,3.25,3.0,3.0,"Appearance: Medium brown with a large and fluffy white head. Cloudy, with tiny bits of what looks to be grapefruit pulp floating about.

Smell: Smells of sweet grapefruit juice with some maltiness.

Taste: Rich malty ale flavours, surprising, I expected the ale to be a bit more downplayed with grapefruit. Sweet and fruity, the grapefruit flavour is immediately apparent, but asserts itself more prominently at the finish. Less tartness and bitterness than I would like from something made with grapefruit.

Mouthfeel: Smooth, easy, but unremarkable.

Overall: Not bad, but remains pretty baseline. The 'fruit' and 'beer' aspects of this fruit beer are equally present, but much of the charm of grapefruit is lost in the ale aspect of the drink. This is interesting, but could be executed better.May 26, 2014"

Taste - Way more malt than I've come to expect from fruit beers. The caramel malts come on first, followed by a good plash of grapefruit and coriander. Bitterness is low.

Mouthfeel - Not to light, not to heavy. Lot's of carbonation. Finish is dry and crisp.Oct 06, 2013"
Whistler Paradise Valley Grapefruit Ale,3.25,2.5,3.25,3.5,"330 mL bottle from the LCBO, courtesy of the BC Craft Brewers Guild sampler. Fruit beers aren't exactly my preferred style, but grapefruit ales typically fare well with me. I like the sleek, upscale bottle on this one, too. Served well-chilled. 

Pours a deep amber orange colour, opaque with haze and topped with a half-finger of soapy, white head that quickly dissipates. The aroma is acidic, and at times almost metallic. Minimal grapefruit on the nose - in fact, minimal everything, as I can barely even pick out any individual aromas. Just some citrus, some generic sweet maltiness, and steel. Not a great way to start things off. 

Not a bad-tasting ale, though I admit it took a few sips for my palate to make sense of this one as the flavour can be a bit muddled. Some bready, grainy malts and honey sweetness comes through at first, followed by lots of pink grapefruit pulp, in addition to a lemony orange citrus flavour. A little vegetal toward the finish, with a wisp of coriander and floral hops completing the profile. The grapefruit in this one is less pronounced/concentrated than in a lot of the radler-type beers I've tried previously, with more of a focus on malts and sweetness. On the light side of medium-bodied, with fairly strong carbonation and very fine bubbles that give this brew a somewhat spritzy mouthfeel; however, the brew also has a syrupy nature that conflicts with this. Easy enough to drink quickly, and I could see myself tossing back at least 2 of these outside on a hot patio before it became tiresome.

Final Grade: 3.20, a passable C+. Paradise Valley Grapefruit Ale is a serviceable fruit beer, but it's just not the sort of thing I can see myself drinking large quantities of - certainly not in early autumn, and probably not in the summer, either. I could see this being reasonably refreshing in hot weather, and to be totally fair, I respect the fact that this particular ale nicely balances its 'fruit' aspects and its ' beer' aspects. That being said, it just isn't doing it for me - this is too sweet and lacks the pleasant tart bitter flavour I love about this fruit. Needless to say, if I want some grapefruit in my beer, I'll probably reach for Stiegl Radler next time.Sep 29, 2013"
Whistler Paradise Valley Grapefruit Ale,3.25,3.5,2.5,2.5,"0 mL bottle, which was way overfilled right to a mm or two of the cap. Still had a good head on the pour, tannish and rocky, colour is a quite hazy orange, cloudy with a lot of visible carbonation. Lacing disappears fairly quickly. 3

S – a sort of very yeasty grapefruit on the nose, ruby citrus with a candied aspect, little bitterness present. But not juicy either, quite dry with bready aromas and fermentation yeasts. 3.5

T – sweet grapefruit juice! Its like cola consistency, sugary body, some grainy malts, and then just a sweet fruity end with a hint of malt. It tastes like some sort of cheap grapefruit soft drink. There is no bitterness of hops beside the cloyingly sweet grapefruit juiciness. 

M – sweet and fizzy, too much carbonation, no body, it is watery and sugary. 

This was a big disappointment for me, like a soft drink with no balance, way too much sweetness. Could be good as a patio downer when you don't really want to taste it, this had a lot of juicy citrus in the profile which took the driving seat for sure. It grew on me slightly, still nothing to write home about.Sep 16, 2013"
Whistler Paradise Valley Grapefruit Ale,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.75,"330 ml bottle from a BC craft beer sampler 6 pack.

A cloudy dark amber colour. At best there is a quarter inch head that quickly becomes a slick and then disappears totally. Fast streams of bubbles that do nothing to maintain a head. No lacing at all.

The aroma is quite weak. Biscuit with a whiff of steel.

There it is ... the flavours are all in the taste. Toffee and biscuit malt and sweetened overripe grapefruit. A slightly sour aftertaste.

A medium to light mouthfeel.

I expected bitter grapefruit and hop bitterness. I got a malty ale with ripe, sweet fruit. No bad.Aug 20, 2013"
Whistler Paradise Valley Grapefruit Ale,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,"341ml Bottle from the Ottawa LCBO

Appearance - Hazy amber colour with an average size fizzy white coloured head. There is an average amount of carbonation showing and there is some fair lacing. The head lasted for around 3 minutes.

Smell - Breads/grains, grapefruit

Taste & Mouth - There is an average amount of carbonation and I can taste breads/grains mixed with some grapefruit. There is also a bit of corn and grass.

Overall - Not a bad fruit beer by any means. Not something I'd drink a whole lot of, but worth a try for sure.Aug 14, 2013"
Whistler Paradise Valley Grapefruit Ale,3.25,3.5,3.25,3.75,"Single bottle from BC Craft Brewers mixed pack at the LCBO. 

Poured into a small nonic. Hazy caramel orange, with a half-inch of foam that recedes all too quickly into the thinnest of rings. 

Nose is sweet grapefruit, malt, citrus, a bit of spice. Not too bad.

Sweeter than I'd expected. The grapefruit is certainly there, though it becomes less apparent the further I get through the bottle. By the end, what I really get is a sweet citrus ale, which leans more towards oranges and sweet grapefruit. There's a mild vegetable taste to the very end of each sip that I'm not digging, but on the whole it's not bad. 

Mouthfeel is certainly very nice - medium thickness, with a nice balanced carbonation. Not over fizzy, so it doesn't end up feeling like a grapefruit soda.

Not bad, I suppose. Certainly something that would go down extremely well on a patio in the heat. Still, quite sweet and rarely something I'd seek out.Aug 12, 2013"
Whistler Paradise Valley Grapefruit Ale,3.0,1.0,2.75,2.0,"1ml bottle poured into a pint glass. From a six-pack bought at the BC Liquor Store.

A: cloudy honey brown with lots of head that dissipated quickly leaving no lacing. 
S: Unappealing. Like stomach acid. I guess that's the grapefruit? I do pick up grapefruit at the end, but that's after I've been hit by this stronger and more unpleasant odour. I'm sorry to say it, but honestly, it makes me kind of nauseous.
T: If I can somehow manage to taste it without smelling it, it's sort of not bad. I do taste the grapefruit, and not a whole lot else, but I'm trying so hard not to smell it that I'm not picking up much.
M: Like flat pop. 

Very disappointing, as I've really enjoyed Whistler's Chai-Maple Ale and Bear Paw Honey Lager.Jun 27, 2013"
Whistler Paradise Valley Grapefruit Ale,3.5,2.75,3.0,3.0,"Poured from a 341ml bottle. Pours a cloudy orange-brown colour. You definitely get a decent whiff of grapefruit on the nose, it just doesn't smell tempting, fresh and vibrant. There's also a hint of malt mingled in, which kind of competes with the grapefruit rather than enhance it. The taste is similarly conflicted. You get some honeyed grapefruit flavours and a little bit of sweet malt. In contrast to some of the grapefruit IPAs out there, this just doesn't put the grapefruit at the forefront enough, nor support it with flavours that are complementary.Apr 30, 2013"
Whistler Paradise Valley Grapefruit Ale,3.5,3.0,4.5,3.5,"Bought this in the middle of a heat wave looking for a refreshing brew. The six-pack came to ~$2.16 per bottle. It pours with huge light biege head which reduces fairly quickly to a finger which persists and some lacing. The body is cloudy and tawny-bronze in colour. The aroma of course has grapefruit, as well as a maltiness. The taste has a great balance of grapefruit, malt and hops. No component overwhelms any other. Medium body, and too much carbonation. Overall, this is a just a fun beer.Aug 08, 2012"
Whistler Paradise Valley Grapefruit Ale,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,"Poured on-tap in Whistler.
A: Pours a nice golden yellowish-orange with 2 inch off-white head.
S: Bright and fresh citrus notes...especially orange and grapefruit.
T: Spicy citrus notes...orange more so than grapefruit again. A hint of malt backbone provides some nice balance.
M: Crisp and fresh mild-moderate hop bite. Hint of smooth malt and a moderate amount of carbonation tingle.
D: A very pleasant surprise! I was expecting a stronger grapefruit presence and I was a bit leery since I am not a huge grapefruit fan. However, this proved to be a very refreshing and highly drinkable brew. A nice summer beer.Jul 15, 2012"
Whistler Paradise Valley Grapefruit Ale,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,"30ml bottle. A new-ish offering from Whistler now available in Alberta.

This beer pours a hazy, medium golden amber colour, with a teeming amount of bubbly, fizzy, and loosely foamy pale beige head, which leaves but a few faint specks of lace around the glass as it hastily subsides.

It smells of sweet orange-infused birthday cake, although more grapefruit than orange, actually (can't think of too many grapefruit cakes in my party-attending history), with some reverie-jolting bitter floral and weedy hops. The taste is more lightly tart and grainy than sweet and bready, with some flat, aged grapefruit juice, and mild spent floral hops.

The bubbles are fairly reserved, perhaps having blown their wad at the outset, the body a decently fruity middleweight, if only a tad cloying in its version of smoothness. It finishes mostly sweet, the neutered citrus still outshining the unassertive grainy malt.

Well more 'grapefruity' than I was anticipating, though on the flip side of those bitter and tart notes so familiar from IPAs and the breakfast staple alike. Drinkable enough, I suppose, for all yer patio occasions - so helpfully suggested on the label - as it is kind of an entry level citrus fruit ale, i.e. not too crisp or challenging.Jun 28, 2012"
Whistler Paradise Valley Grapefruit Ale,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Appearance - Pours a foggy shade of ruby red grapefruit juice with a 1/4 finger width of bubbly head.

Smell - Grapefruit, other citrus, slight hops. Smells a lot like grapefruit juice.

Taste - Tart grapefruit upfront along with lemon and light hops. 

Mouthfeel - Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Crisp and dry.

Overall - An enjoyable fruit ale by Whistler. I didn't know what to expect with the grapefruit, but I find that it is well balanced in the brew. A definite summer refresher.May 27, 2012"
Whistler Paradise Valley Grapefruit Ale,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,"0ml bottle poured into tulip 24/5/12

A murky pinkish orange, a fast falling two finger head leaves no lace, nice color though and loads of tiny particles and slow moving bubbles, looks thick

T lots of pink grapefruit rind and it tastes real unlike many fruit beers, there was more too the nose but still pretty good

Whistler Paradise Valley Grapefruit Ale,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Props to my bro for the tasty selection...

A - Pours a murky hazy orange, finger of head with some retention and no real lacing.

S - Very fruity, with the sour citrus notes coming through nicely alongside some bready malts and musty wheat.

T - The grapefruit comes through nicely and is reminiscent of a sourdough bread with a touch of sweetness, quite citrusy and the wheat flavours give it a nice backbone.

M - A tad lighter and could come across a tad thin, though smooth and wet on the finish.

O - A great summer ale that would be perfectly suitable for patio drinking or backyard barbecue. Highly recommended if its available in your neighbourhood!Mar 15, 2012"
Whistler Paradise Valley Grapefruit Ale,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,"When I first saw this in stores, I was intrigued. I've never been a fan of grapefruit anything, but I thought, what the heck.

First time I had it was in a bottle. Poured a hazy amber-yellow colour with a thin off-white head. Nice amount of carbonation, and smelled nice and citrusy...maybe even a little bready. The flavour surprised me though. I was expecting more grapefruit flavour, but honestly, I mostly got citrus and hops. I liked it though. Enough that I sought out a local pub that had it on tap.

On tap: Same hazy colour, but better carbonation. The aroma was much more prominent and the flavor was stronger. The same citrus and hops flavour was noticable, but this time, I could actually taste a hint of grapefruit. I'd say, if you were thinking about giving this beer a go, try it on tap first. It's far better.

Overall, an excellent summer beer. Whistler did a really good job with this one, I think.Sep 11, 2011"
Whistler Paradise Valley Grapefruit Ale,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,"This is a great sign for the BC brewing scene that more and more brewers are releasing seasonal releases in bombers. Like Russell and Lighthouse , Whistler is having a chance to show off their skills in a beer not aimed at the average Joe. 

This is a pretty cool Summer beer. A well done APA with decent hops combined with the flavours of grapefruit. It works in my opinion because the grapefruit is not overpowering but instead opens up as the beer warms and provides a fruity note to the finish and the nose. Very much a summer ale with an original twistJul 05, 2011"
Whistler Paradise Valley Grapefruit Ale,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,"Appearance. Pours a slightly hazy yellow-amber with a little pink as the previous reviewer noted. Thin pale yellow head that doesn't last long.

Smell. Light grains and plenty of pink grapefruit. Just a hint of floral hops. A little wet dog in there.

Taste. Pink grapefruit juice ...lots of it too. A little toasty light grain and a bit of grassy/citrus hops. 

Mouthfeel. Lighter body with medium light carbonation.

Overall. I like a good fruit beer, but this is way over the top with grapefruit for me. Not a bad beer, but you better love grapefruit. Luckily I do and would hapilly drink another pint of this on a hot summer day.Jun 29, 2011"
Whistler Paradise Valley Grapefruit Ale,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,"Grapefruit and beer...sounds odd, and really not something you'd think of having. I'll admit - I bought it and was somewhat hesitant to try it. Combined with the fact the while Whistler is a decent brewery, they're nothing amazing...I thought this was pretty radical.

This was surprising! A pinky-amber colour with a thin white head. It describes itself as a ""summer blonde"" but is quite a bit darker than a blonde. It verges on pale ale/IPA territory.

There is a definite presence of grapefruit in the scent. Its distinct and unavoidable. Sweet citrus, and a light brown sugar background. I'm sure there is a hop profile in there, but the grapefruit devours any hop scents.

The grapefruit is less dominant in the taste, and I think this is a good thing. Sweet, acidic citrus, a light fresh bread and a definite sour grapefruit finish. Its actually fairly well blended and works nicely.

Decent, light carbonation. A really great summer beer. I only wish I had this earlier and sat out on the deck with it.Jun 04, 2011"

Camden Pale Ale,4.0,4.0,2.5,2.5,"In the UK with so many class Pale Ales and IPAs' you have to come up with some thing really special to cut above the best - sadly nice as it is this does not. It on pouring has the look and smell of a proper Pale Ale but on tasting the expectation falls away. Its nice but that's it, nice. It does not excite the palate. Yes it has the fruity hoppy aroma of a Pale Ale but the taste is simply bland - a standard beer. Want an exciting Pale Ale then from the North its Timothy Taylors 'Landlord' or the South - Badgers 'Hopping Hare'. London then forget this and try Fullers Bengal Lancer for a real taste sensation.Jun 29, 2019"
Camden Pale Ale,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"a pretty classic pale ale here that tasted a lot brighter and fresher than many other we had around london, and despite some negative murmurs about these guys, i thought his was pretty good, clean and drinkable for an english style with some unassuming crisping hop bitterness in the finish and nice balance overall. a little english crystal type malt gives this a light brassy hue, good white head on it, and not quite all the way clear but close. aroma and flavor show a simple and traditional english malt profile, supported by a mild but distinct ale yeast, and plenty of hoppy zip. its not as aromatic or flavorful on the hops as some, more old school in that way, but the bitterness is certainly there in the taste, and the freshness is obvious, way more than seemed to be the standard around the city. good carbonation keeps it moving, and it stays together well as it warms. a light orange peel citrus note marries in well with the bready yeast, and its drier at the end than many. overall pretty good, nothing to dislike at all here, not sure why it gets a bad rap...May 20, 2019"

Average in every way. Well, to be fair, I actually like the nose on this beer a bit more than average, but the flavor is a bit below, so it all comes out even.

Camden Pale Ale,3.5,4.0,3.75,3.75,"0ml bottle into a conical 2/3 pint glass. Paid £1.99 for a single bottle.

Pours a deep golden-amber coloured body that displays plenty of fine streaming carbonation when held to the light. A thin, one-finger in height, bubbly, white head reduces disappointingly quickly to a frothy collar, leaving only a small amount of broken sticky lacing.

A fragrant, hop forward nose leads with a delicious mix of sweet tropical fruit and juicy citrus flesh. Tangerine, grapefruit and lemon are easily detectable along with some subtler floral and pine notes in the background. Initially, ripe tropical fruits lead the flavour profile, above a soft, vaguely sweet and bready malt backbone. Fresh, juicy orange notes become apparent throughout the mid palate, while grapefruit and lemon zest gradually build, transforming the beer from sweet and fruity to crisp and lightly bitter. A light body and soft carbonation give a mouth-feel that is reasonably smooth and creamy, despite being a tad thin. On the end, lingering citrus peels provide just enough drying bitterness to balance the sweet start and make you want to take another sip.

Overall this is an excellent beer. It’s bright and clean, easy drinking, and at only 4% ABV hugely sessionable. It hides its 40 IBU’s well, managing to deliver plenty of fruity and citrusy hop flavour, without an intense bitterness. I am not usually a fan of the style, but this I could certainly drink more of.

Camden Pale Ale,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.0,"A 330ml bottle showing 4.0% ABV.

Definitely a British style of pale ale. The malt base is solid and doesn't play second fiddle to the (American) hops. The grain bill comprises mainly (light and dark) lager malts which produce a lovely, rich, pale amber colour and a satisfying, crisp texture. The nose is malty and subtle. But after a decent start the taste and mouthfeel are both disappointingly lacklustre and thin. An ok session beer but I wonder if this was better in its original 5% ABV format?

Pint from Budweiser bar at O2 Arena.
Man, this beer is nothing special now ABInbev have their claws in it. Pale amber, faint malt nose, faint malt taste. Smooth, oily mouthfeel is the best bit. A pale ale version of bud, basically.

Trying this beer again on 11 Dec 2019. This time in the excellent ‘Scottish Stores’ pub in Kings Cross, London. Draught pint.

Much better than the O2 aberration. Still one dimensional and a tad thin but it looks great and the citrusy hops (grapefruit!) produce a refreshing, easy-drinking, modern, session ale.Oct 15, 2015"
Camden Pale Ale,4.75,3.75,3.5,4.0,"On tap, poured into a sampler glass. The aromas are pronounced bread and caramel notes. It pours a brilliant and effervescent amber hue with a dense, whipped, white head that has good retention and a great coat of lace. The taste is a well balanced medium bittersweet. The light texture has a bit of a syrupy quality to it with a soft, foamy carbonation. The medium body has muted caramel flavoring with oranges and a slight roastiness.

Taste is fruity upfront, a bit light. Gets a bit nutty, light midway then a bit yeasty. Decent but yeah, a bit light on hops with bitterness taking a back seat to yeast. Dry, not bad, but nose promised a lot and taste could use more bitterness, even for a pale ale.

Camden Pale Ale,3.75,3.75,4.0,3.5,"0ml bottle purchased from Camperdown Cellars, Parramatta Road.

Pours a very clear, very bright pale golden colour, with a fine white head that settles out to a fair ring. Carbonation is quite fine and refined. Lacing is minimal, but given the minimal head and the body, it's not all that surprising. Looks pretty decent overall.

Nose is great. Clean, crisp and direct hop fragrance makes it bright and sharp from the get-go. Slight faint lemon character and a soda brightness wrap it up. Not much in the way of malt, but it doesn't need it. Pretty tasty.

Taste is great, very clean and bright, with a crispness on the back from the hops. Feel is very light, but it has a very pleasant lemon character which runs through from front to back. It's extremely drinkable.

Yep. Cracking, easy-drinking beer. I'd missed the bandwagon Camden takeovers which seemed to ram through all of the Australian east-coast craft beer pubs recently, but I would have been suitably impressed if this was the first refreshing beer I had on-tap. If the price-point is right, this would be a great pick for a clean, summer BBQ beer. It paired very nicely with some rock oysters seasoned with lemon and cracked pepper.Jan 03, 2014"

Smell is strongly hopped, quite piney, strong floral character. Also a bit of brown sugar sweetness which is nice. Bready malt in the background. Grapefruit citrus, green apple freshness.

Taste has a biscuity maltiness with a fair bit of herbal hops coming through. There is a bit of the piney resin character presumably from the cascade hops but seems meek in comparison to American version. A bit bready malt body here, some fruitiness and on the finish it turns more to the bitter dry hops. 

Mouthfeel is mild and smooth, light bodied session ale, very little carbonation, but it has enough bitter crispness to make it quite refreshing, finishes quite dry. 

Interesting combination, more hopped than your average english PA, possibly more malty than a typical American. It falls somewhere in between, has some good flavour going on, still a couple of rough areas where it could be more interesting and balanced, a bit of a tug-of-war between malt and hops at points. Really decent stuff though, and for a low ABV it packs some flavour.Jan 31, 2013"

A good mix of fruit and hops to begin with along with some mild pine notes and definitely some grapefruit following this. The taste is quite light and summery with a slight bitter kick right at the end.

Smooth on the palate with a medium body and carbonation levels about the same. There was a subtle alcohol kick around the middle to back end and a refreshing, easy going finish that was slightly bitter and quite fruity.

Primator English Pale Ale,3.0,3.5,3.75,3.75,"A: Copper toffee with no carbonation, relatively clean filtered and a 4 finger light beige head.


S: Toffee, caramel, toast, child’s aspirin.


T: Banana, tea, astringent, hard water, dull bitter hops, a sort of glue taste.


M: Medium chewy body like water thickened by iron, little carbonation.


O: Fascinating. A Check beer based on an English style. I get the style, just some unique attributes that make me say its not your typical beer from Britain. Sort of how Coopers is somehow different because its from Australia, and some US companies have their own versions of this style. Somehow not British, but its own animal.

Primator English Pale Ale,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,"Funny; a Czech-brewed ""English Pale Ale"" which I had in a Slovak pub. The beer pours a bright, yellow-brown color with a persistent creamy yellow-white head. 

Smell: Hoppy and malty, fresh citrus (grapefruit) sweet honey/caramel

Taste: Sweet, full of honey, some hints of grapefruit, with a surprising and sudden bitter aftertaste (hoppy).

Overall: A nice beer, not too special, but a very decent brew. Would not refuse another oneAug 24, 2009"
Primator English Pale Ale,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,"Picked up in a supermarket in Brno. The brown 33cl bottle has a long neck and a red, green and gold label featuring the depiction of a monastery above the label. The back label lists ingredients in Czech and Slovak, neither of which i can decipher. Best before 9/1/09, I opened it on 1/18/09.

Pours a clear copper-orange under a one finger beige head that settles slowly to collar and film, but leaves no trace of lace on my glass. The nose is mild, with a hint of grain and a touch of berries. The mouth is fairly thick and well-carbonated. The taste is smooth, with some sweetbread malt in the opening and clearly English hops (ruddles?) backing it up. It does in fact taste like an English pale ale, and not a bad one, either. The mild but long-lasting bitter aftertaste invites another sip, much as the best British ales do.Jan 18, 2009"
Primator English Pale Ale,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Impressive half-glass head; recedes slowly; clear copper color; leaves light lace.

Mostly malt aroma; I detect a small level of metal in the smell.

Like an English mild but far more thicker. The carbonation is very low given the richness--reminds me of a cask drawn beer. The hop level is almost imperceptible, even the finish is malty.

I think this beer could easily get lost in Britain. A great diversion from the light bodied lagers in the Czech Republic.Dec 07, 2008"
Primator English Pale Ale,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Although it is labelled as an English Pale Ale, it is rather darker than many I have had - distinctly red in colour and with a nice head.

Arcobrau Schloss Dunkel,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,"On tap at Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Beautiful dark ruby colour, moderate off-white head.

Arcobrau Schloss Dunkel,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Ruby tinted brown with a fat finger of tan head. 

Sweet malt and banana in the nose. Slightly less sweet tasting, but otherwise has a fairly similar light banana bread flavor, maybe some light caramel, with a clean finish.

Arcobrau Schloss Dunkel,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,"Today’s brew comes from Moos Germany [must insert cow jokes at some point in this review] is a fine upstanding Dunkel by my new German fancy Arcobräu. Arcobräu was until recently a figment of my imagination in a municipality that is a paradise to dairy farmers and their bovine property alike with lush rolling green hills, troughs as far as the eye can see, and buckets strategically placed wherever cows are likely to stand. In fact the dairy farmers liked this place so much they named it after the noise cows make. Turns out Moos exists in reality and now I’m off to find the county of Meow on Google Earth. I will report my findings post haste.

Poured from a 500ml bottle into a fancy DAB stein.

A: Clear deep almost cola brown body with a firm 1 inch off-white head... German brewers always take pride in their head and it shows here. 8/10.

S: A rich tapestry of aromas with caramel, macerated dark plum and figs, a touch of bread and is that a hint of banana or am I going crazy? [probably... to both] The aroma of this brew suggests a malt heavy beverage, which is totally fine by me, bring on the malts I say! 7/10.

T: Flavour is a little more subdued than expected but still tasty nonetheless with the above noted caramel/macerated dark plum and figs/bread with an odd but added note of cola, some light nuttiness and a slight metallic aftertaste. The finish is Munich dry with a hint of hops. Overall the flavour is solid if a little weak. 7/10.

M: Mid to light bodied with a medium carbonation - good for the style and good for that belching contest I was planning on entering, aka my average beer drinking session. 8/10.

D: Soooo, no major complaints with this Dunkel aside from the usual cry of “more flavour” - then again 4.7% ABV Dunkels aren’t usually flavour-bombs so one might say my opinion is slightly unjustified, but I won’t... shuddup. Also that cola taste and the metallic note detracted from my flavour score... but other than that it’s all G brah. The big question is will I have this again when I can get a Weihenstephaner or a König Ludwig for cheaper? My money is on the cheaper/better Weihenstephaner [I love those guys!]. 7/10.

Food match: Sauerbraten mit Kartoffelklöße, Rotkohl und Spätzle will serve you well on your Dunkel quest... giant Pretzel mit senf if you’re saving room for more beer ;-)Oct 05, 2015"

Arcobrau Schloss Dunkel,5.0,4.75,5.0,5.0,"amazing, a dark beer for the regular drinker that is brewed traditionally like a dark should be. there is finally a dark beer i can drink until the sun comes up. No aussie dark lager can compete, smooth, light, malty goodness. the bartender said the tap was 4.6% ABV, looking forward to accompanying this beer with winter food. i think this is the same beer as the arcobrau dark lager.May 06, 2013"
Arcobrau Schloss Dunkel,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.75,"Appearance: The dark, copper red colored beer is served in a Shaker pint glass with a 1/4"" ivory head that slowly recedes to a film over the liquid. Sipping creates scattered patches of lacing.

Smell: The aromas include dark orchard fruits and some noticeable breadiness.

Taste: The flavors are much as expected from the nose with the dark fruits (cherry, raisin, figs, plums). The sweetness from the malt is punctuated with hints of earthy spiciness.

Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is medium bodied and lightly prickly with the persistent moderated carbonation. The medium length finish begins as the sweetness and fruit flavors start to fade to eventually leave behind only some dry earthiness from the hops.

Drinkability and overall impression: This is a reasonably good dunkel that is solid in that it touches most all of the right bases. That said I'll not be looking to have a second one since there are a one or two others I prefer, if only because they are more easily found.Oct 22, 2012"
Arcobrau Schloss Dunkel,3.5,3.0,4.0,5.0,"First off this is a Dunkel not a Dunkleweizen. Bought in a 500 ml bottle in Korea.

A: Pours out with a deep mahogany brown, little yellowish head that dissipates quickly, and even small bubbled carbonation.

S: Roasted malts and metal

T: Rich malted barley up front and through out, earthy Tettnager hops, and grassy grains.

M: The true balance that a Dunkel Lager brings, not drying but not too wet either. You feel refreshed by its balance of bitter and sweet, dry and wet, finished with a nice watery finish. Suitable for all seasons.

Overall: Solid beer overall. No complaints here as it truly represents a standard Dunkel Lager.Aug 02, 2012"
Arcobrau Schloss Dunkel,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,"Most excellent German Dunkel. Was lucky 
enough to be at the Brauhaus Schmitz in Philly when they tapped this keg, first time in US I believe. The bartender suggested this beer and
gave out samples, everybody that tasted it got
one, it was that good. 
Poured a rich brown color with a nice 
foamy head. Taste was outstanding, caramel,
malty goodness. 
Still light enough to be a good summer/session beer. 
I am a big fan of the dunkels, i've had the 
best, spatan, warsteiner, Ayinger,Hofbrau,
in my opinion the Arcobrau is the best of the
bunch, far better than any American dunkel.Jul 06, 2012"
Arcobrau Schloss Dunkel,4.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,"APPEARANCE: Very dark amber with bright orange light peering through the perimeters of the Pilsner glass. Creamy beige head with a scattering of large irridescent bubbles. Classy lacing.

SMELL: Metallic roasted Malt and caramel.

TASTE: Metallic roasted malt offset by lovely dark caramel and walnut. A quality, well rounded flavour. Not overly complex but not simple either. Reminiscent of the König Ludwig Dunkel but smoother.

OVERALL: For a Dunkelweizen it's incredibly dark and strong tasting. Has a classic German flavour profile which occurs in all types of German ales and lagers. It may not take you to heaven and back but it's still very sound. I highly recommend the hefe-weisse.Mar 26, 2012"
Hitachino Nest Sweet Stout,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.0,"Blind-tasted except for the beer's name and brewery/country, zero reviews below read (yet!)...
L- Inky black, though held in front of a halogen there is the slightest glimmer of deepest ruby through the waisted glass. Pours with a dark tan cap of foam. Holds well.
S- Slightly toasty, it might also have a hint of cocoa to it. 
T- Reminds me of watery iced coffee. It also has a charred aspect, but it's not outright smokey.
F- It has the challenge of a quite pungent lower-ABV% beer --> it comes over as thin on mouth-feel.
O- My first sip wasn't great, but I'm surprised that my palate is adjusting to it. It doesn't seem to have a clear sweet note to me, 'some richness' instead, and I do *not* like sweetness in beer. Interesting to try, something a bit different but not one I'd buy or wish to drink again. I might suggest serving well chilled to take the edge off any sweetness.
Review2033/scoring all done, now the reveal, I get to read the lables to see what I missed! Contains: Wheat, malted barley and lactose!? Haha... I get the Sweet/Milk Stout style etc but surprising as according to which source you trust up to 90% of Japanese are lactose intolerant!

Hitachino Nest Sweet Stout,3.25,3.0,2.75,3.0,"This one is just odd. It caused me a double take of sorts as I sipped at it to try and sort out what it was I was tasting. Just a hint of sweet, a mild dose of sour milk, and then some gently pleasant earthiness. An acquired or regional taste I think, and definitely not to everyone’s taste.

Aroma: not much here, some caramel, brown sugar. 
Taste: vegetable, vinegar, plum, tar. Aftertaste is cardboard. Not good. 

Such a disappointment, since the Hitachino espresso stout is excellent. I am somewhat amazed at the way the head builds after the beer has settled. I’ll have to bust out an old fluid mechanics textbook someday to see if I can explain it.""

Hitachino Nest Sweet Stout,3.75,2.75,3.0,3.25,"330ml bottle poured into a Hitachino Nest’s glass.

Very dark brown to almost black in color, the pour builds up thick fluffy tan head that stands with good retention before slowly subsiding to everlasting foamy crown and leaving some lacing behind.

The aroma of sour milk from lactose sugar, some malt sweetness and roastiness, and creamy chocolate too.

Sour milk dominates with a slight roasted malt character. Same time you also get big tartness, big acidic and lactic, slight sweet, slight astringency, and finish with sourness and tartness again.

Medium body with semi-smooth mouthfeel from some lively carbonation, finish is dry. Too much sour even considering to the style, nonetheless, it has some roasted profile to confirm that it is Stout while the rest is just pure acidic and sour.Jun 19, 2016"

S: Moderate aromas of roasted malts, lactose sweetness, and chocolate.

Hitachino Nest Sweet Stout,3.75,4.25,4.0,4.25,"Poured a deep black body with brown highlights when held to light and one finger of bubbly tan head that quickly receded. Overall impression of appearance is of a light stout, with a nice dark body and head formation that starts large yet recedes quickly. Not bad. Scents of milk chocolate and roast malt, light lactic sourness, yogurt-like, moderate notes of coffee with cream sweet cream, some light leather and dark fruit aromas add an aged feel. Overall impression of aroma is of a very apparent milk stout, but one with a great deal of other aromas present adding depth and making this an appealing beer. Flavor begins mildly sweet with notes of coffee with cream, bittersweet and milk chocolates and a light lactic acid sourness. This moves into a dry middle, with notes of coffee, dark chocolate and cream with a still light lactic sourness. Finish is dry with notes of dark coffee and chocolate, roasted malt at moderately high levels, cream at medium levels, hints of raisin at very light levels and a light lactic sourness. Aftertaste is robust roasted malt and a light cream flavor. Overall impression of flavor is of a rather dry stout, not really the sweet stout claimed on the bottle. Still a rather nice dry milk stout, with a pleasant sourness working well with the roast malt. A rather simple overall profile, but still quite pleasant. Mouthfeel is light bodied with light carbonation and a smooth, slightly chalky feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a dry stout, rather pleasant and easily sessionable. Overall this is an excellent dry milk stout. It showcases the addition of the lactose in aroma and flavor and blends it well with the malt while still staying dry. As a sweet stout it lacks, but overall it is a fine example of a different sort of stout, one that is a touch experimental and very pleasant to drink.Apr 04, 2015"
Hitachino Nest Sweet Stout,2.25,3.25,2.5,2.5,"Pours black with head that thins to less than a lace. Smells of sweet chocolate malts...a little mild.

Smell is sour with roasted malt, cocoa, and fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with sour roast, cocoa, char, metallic, and funk flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

Hitachino Nest Sweet Stout,3.5,2.0,3.5,3.0,"I always get über excited when I review a new beer from Japan (I even need to put the umlaut over the ‘u’ when spelling über). Why do you get so excited Doc? Because Japanese brewers almost always manage to give their brews a unique twist, and Hitachino Nest is one of the uniquest (not a word, I know, cram it) of the unique Japanese brewers. So much so that I feel like using my angry samurai voice when I say “Hitachino!”. Lacto Stouts, as you well know informed reader, are brewed with lactose, which is basically milk sugar (and unfermentable), this imparts smoothness and sweetness. I wish more brewers brewed this style, I love a good Milk Stout!

Poured from a 330ml bottle into a nonic pint.

A: Black as the night is dark, as they say, with a nice khaki lace ring around the glass. I’m not going to lie - I’m looking forward to this. 7/10.

S: Woah, funky, roasty and toasty. Smells a touch like off milk, and the BB date on the label says: 07 2013 - better let Plonk know about that. A second whiff reveals a milk chocolate slant, but I still can’t shake away that milk funk. 4/10.

T: Sweet roasted malt with smoke notes upfront. There is undertones of chocolate as well. Finish has a miniscule amount of bitterness, just enough to counter the sweetness a touch. Aftertaste has an interesting amount of acidity (normally you would get this from the hops) that makes the tongue salivate a little. Delicate and well-rounded for a Stout. Thankfully the milk funk is just an aroma thing. 7/10.

M: Mid to light bodied with a flat carbonation, the body is decent given the 4% ABV, feels like a heavier beer. 6/10.

D: Not bad HITACHINO!* not bad at all. Whilst this doesn’t come close to beating their fantastic Red Rice Ale it is a nice quiet, slightly bashful, evening sipper. That’s it. You want more? Well, ok then - Hitachino Nest Sweet Stout Lacto is overpriced, there I said it, and if you’re looking for Doc’s favourite Milk Stout: bad news, I’m still searching for it... Though I had a superb Australian Milk Stout years, nay a decade, ago but I can’t remember who brewed it or where to get it (I’ll find you one day Milk Stout!). 7/10.

Food match: Chocolate pie, or something else chocolate related, like chocolate cats (I made that one up fool!).

Hitachino Nest Sweet Stout,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.5,"(purchased at NoLibs Foodery(?), chilled - bottle code SS.12.04 - poured into a balloon)

A: impenetrably dark brown liquid... compact foam forms, about a finger width high, then dies down, leaving a spongy-bubbly collar but no lace

S: coffee and creme, the chocolate coating for a Ho-Ho, faint smoky ash, hint of black candy licorice, hint of lactic funk... later, it takes on a wet lawn and soil note, with a drop of chocolate-coated hard caramel candy underneath... the combo of ash and acids seem to dominate, with sub-medium intensity

T: it's held up pretty decent... dark cacao and roasted barley tea up front... light-moderately tart and acidic up front as well, leaving a mellow bitter bite in the finish... not much sweetness like sugar, maybe a thin thread of it left... mildly roasty and pretty dry... hints of turning

M: sub-medium viscosity up front... attenuates out somewhat thin and flat in the finish... a little residual roast matter left, mild scraping, but, again, pretty dry

O: decent for a dry stout... can't endorse it for a sweet stout, though Kiuchi has some fringe approaches to their products... it certainly did hold up alright after 2 years, maybe not so surprisingMay 22, 2014"

Hitachino Nest Sweet Stout,2.75,3.0,3.25,3.0,"Sweet Stout has the black and visibly bubbly appearance of Coca-Cola, as it fizzes vigorously on the initial pour, and its head vanishes only a moment later. For the aroma, I pick up caramel and only an inkling of coffee and chocolate...Unfortunately there's what can be described as a metallic off-scent present. The taste however, is quite a bit better. It has a light, milky chocolate flavor, similar to a 'Three Musketeers' candy bar, but it comes with a slightly chalky finish. I don't really mind how it is thin, because I knew that by the ABV % and I happen to like sessionable stouts & porters. Overall though, I expected more from the Kiuchi brewery. I am going to try their Espresso Stout next, as the reviews are much more favorable. In regards to this one, reach for a Guinness instead!Sep 11, 2013"
Hitachino Nest Sweet Stout,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Poured from 330mL bottle into a pint glass.

Appearance: very dark brown with just a hint of ruby highlight when held up to the light. There appears to be a bit of a light haze to the beer as well; head is a thin layer of tan foam which dissipates to nothing pretty quickly. Not bad color, but the head formation is pretty unfortunate.

Smell: sweet malt with a light roastiness and a pretty nice chocolate aroma. The volume could be turned up a bit, but in general the composition is nice.

Taste: light and sweet, with a chocolatey character and a hint of acidity. There's a bit of a fruitiness here, too, probably due to the sweetness. It's not particularly stout, but it is a tasty enough beer. 

Mouthfeel: light-medium body with a decent level of carbonation and creaminess.

Overall: tasty enough and quite drinkable at less than 4%. I might not put this at the top of my list, but for a dark, sessionable beer, this is pretty good (if a little on the sweet side).Jul 16, 2013"
Hitachino Nest Sweet Stout,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.0,"Bottle into tulip at hitachino tasting 2013. Deep black color with a bit of tan head. Nice roasty sweet malty aroma with a hint of chocolate.

Hitachino Nest Sweet Stout,3.0,2.75,2.75,2.0,"A, It has a dark brown color, with very little head and basically no lace. Only a bit of light shining through.

S. A bit of a nut scent.

T/M/O. It has a very lame stout taste. There isn't much of a taste there. It is metallic and a bit burnt. Chalky and dry. It is medium bodied, if not a bit less. It just tastes low quality and the after taste really is unappealing.Jul 13, 2013"
Hitachino Nest Sweet Stout,3.25,3.5,3.0,2.75,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a footed tulip.

A: Very dark brown. Pours about 1 finger, bubbly, brown head. Settles very quickly. Very spotty lacing quickly retreats back into the brew.

S: Dark roasted malt with a very prominent sweet cream smell.

T: Char roasted malt with just a touch of unsweetened dark chocolate, and just a rumor of black licorice.

M: Really earthy, and almost mealy feeling. Kind of light and shallow. Lightly sweet aftertaste. Something of a carbonated feel.

D: You can power through this.

Atmosphere is decent. Dark hue, not much of a head, and no lacing though. Nose is roasted malt with a really strong sweetness. Charred malt, with very little else. Overall, this is an okay quaff.Jun 02, 2013"

Stephans Brau Schwarzbier,3.0,3.25,3.25,2.75,"Bought from a local grocery store in Shanghai. Poured from the 500mL can into a pint glass.

A: The beer has a good thick consistency with the color of cola - dark brown with some light coming in on the sides. Head was light tan. OK looking beer, now to the good stuff.

S: Dark bready malt in there with a tinge of sweetness that reminds a bit of bitter chocolate. Some roasty notes trying to come though but more sweetness. OK smelling beer.

T: Pretty good taste there, although a bit watery. Some roasted notes but mostly malty sweetness and bread. 

Overall, an ok beer for the price. Drinkable but nothing to go out of your way for. An alright pickup - there are definitely better drinks out there, but the price is right.May 06, 2014"
Stephans Brau Schwarzbier,3.5,3.0,3.25,3.25,"Dark brown pour, almost black, one finger tan head. Looks close to a nice stout.
Low smell of roasted malts, bit of sweetness.
Surprisingly crisp for its style, lots of citrus zest, also acidic apple. Roasted malts, not too heavy, with some caramel and watered-down coffee notes. Not very bitter either.
Light body, more than mild carbonation goes well with the zestiness.
Refreshing, dirt-cheap, decent enough.Mar 19, 2014"

S: Metal.

T: Dosey, dry and metallic. I can taste the alcohol. Has a subtle but zingy apple aftertaste, if that's possible. Not bursting with flavour.

M: Very lackluster, almost flat. Greasy.

Appearance: Dark brown with reddish orange tinge when held to the light. Less than half a finger of light tan foam, which was all but gone in about a minute.

Smell: Very sweet aroma, malt, trace of bubblegum, floral.

Taste: Roasted malt is there but not strong, some hops bitterness but again not strong. Middle of the road for a schwarzbier.

Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied. Lots of carbonation. Dry finish with a lingering bitterness.

Overall: Would be good with a fresh hot pretzel. Nothing really stands out for this beer, though. It is an okay quaff, I didn't mind it, but I'd choose another schwarzbier next time. Just not exciting.Oct 12, 2011"
Stephans Brau Schwarzbier,3.5,3.25,3.75,3.5,"Canned 500ml. brewed by Eichbaum for Czech Kaufland Supermarket but also sold by some independent(?) markets which is where I found this can in Prague.

smell: full of cocoa and a little sweetness.
Taste: Chocolate is definitely the forward flavour here, however there is an odd aftertaste that I find doesn't work with the chocolate at least for me.
Feel: decent amount of body.

Meantime Chocolate Porter,3.5,3.75,4.0,4.0,"L- Looks black until held to the light when you see glints of ultra-deep ruby within it. Clear, pours with 3mm tan head of very fine bubbles that is holding well.
S- Toasty cocoa and coffee notes.
T- Woah, quite impactful on a fresh palate. Deep cocoa, coffee, and they develop in strength too. It's finish is deep and pungent.
F- It feels/tastes a solid brew, one for sipping slowly. Would go well with dessert, perhaps with a tiramisu of chocolate pudding.
O- Nothing out of place noted, lovely balance. I'm not a born drinker of black beer (blame Guiness) but this one is another example of black beer done seriously and very well. I would buy this again [/pinches myself].

330ml bottle BB: 11/June/2020 Bought as I recall from Waitrose, at about £2.05/bottle. Comes in a regular 330ml beer bottle instead of the mini champagne style bottle pictured above. Also this bottle is marked 6.5% i/o the 5.5% listed above, and I imagine that changes it's character in a material way (for the better!).Jun 22, 2019"
Meantime Chocolate Porter,4.0,4.0,3.75,4.0,"Pours a deep dark brown with some ruby highlight when held to the light. Head is smallish and leaves a little lace. Nose is not big, but has an nice milk chocolate aroma along with maybe just a whiff of coffee and molasses. Taste is soft and mellow, with light rounded roasted notes along the light chocolate and lactose. It is nice, but a bit too soft.

Meantime Chocolate Porter,3.75,4.0,3.5,3.5,"Dark brown, filtered and no carbonation. Topped with 3 fingers of light beige head. Nice lacing.

Chocolate, vanilla, banana, clean linen.

Chocolate, linen, a hint of tobacco, light sweetness.

Medium light body, little carbonation.

Quite well done, just not as heavy as other Baltic Porters I've had, and more refined like a porter. Got in Bangkok in July, 2015, drank in Chiang Mai March 9th, 2016. Carried this one on my epic Harbin voyage.Mar 09, 2016"

Meantime Chocolate Porter,3.75,3.75,4.0,3.75,"330ml, baby Champagne-style bottle, and nice to see this London craft brewer's wares re-appear in Alberta.

This beer pours a clear, rather dark red-brick brown colour, with one skinny-ass finger of puffy, densely foamy, and mildly bubbly beige head, which leaves some low-lying melting snowbank lace around the glass as it evenly subsides.

It smells of gritty, semi-sweet milk chocolate, grainy caramel malt, biscuity toffee, slightly spicy anise root, and a plain earthy, leafy noble hop bitterness. The taste is bready, pastry-like caramel malt, bittersweet cocoa powder, a muddled black licorice edginess, ethereal hints of day-old cafe-au-lait, and more understated weedy, earthy hop bitterness.

The carbonation is adequately fizzy and frothy for the task of keeping the guest ingredient honest, I suppose, the body a sturdy medium weight, and generally smooth, the chocolate going a long way in support of that. It finishes off-dry, but not as sweet as one might have imagined at the outset - plenty of counteracting bitterness helping out in that respect.

Overall, a decently restrained chocolate ale (porter, in this case), the milkiness hard to differentiate as being innate to the purported style here, or just a side effect from the cocoa. Whatever, it's good, easy to drink, and worthy of compelling me once again to fire up some Spacehog on YouTube, from the 1990s' one-hit wonder dustbin!Oct 28, 2015"
Meantime Chocolate Porter,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Dark brown, semi-opaque and clear, with a beige head with decent retention. It has a smell fresh, with cocoa, vanilla, milk chocolate, roasted malts.

Meantime Chocolate Porter,3.0,3.25,3.5,3.25,"330ml Bottle: at 6.5% ABV, this is the same beer: poured into a Westvleteren chalice on 5th Nov 2013.

Lovely red hue to the dark body, sadly the tan coloured head soon fell away to a wispy covering.

The nose was surprise, surprise, fairly chocolatey in nature, rich, dark chocolate to be exact.

Taste wise it was also chocolate led in flavour, some coffee notes too: as it warmed a little some sweet vanilla hints began to arrive.

Medium bodied for a Porter and not at all creamy, although it was fairly smooth in the mouth.

Not as powerful or flavoursome as I expected: not bad, but no world beater.Nov 05, 2013"
Meantime Chocolate Porter,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Picked up at De Bierkoning in Amsterdam.

Poured into a tulip glass - dark, almost black color, but with a low enough viscosity that light can peak through the glass. As such, much less creamy, or full, as a stout. Nice hints of chocolate, and the light carbonation perks it up so you chocolate notes pop back up in the aftertaste.

On the label, it recommends to have as a desert beer or digestif, but I would defer to something a tad stronger, fuller-bodied.Sep 15, 2013"
Meantime Chocolate Porter,3.75,3.75,4.0,3.75,"A: The beer is clear but very dark brownish red in color and has ever so slight hints of visible carbonation. It poured with a short off white head that quickly died down, leaving patches of bubbles in the center of the glass and a collar around the edge. 
S: Light aromas of chocolate are present in the nose. 
T: Similar to the smell, the taste is quite chocolately and tastes like a watered down version of Hershey's Chocolate Syrup without the sweetness and some hints of bitterness. 
M: It feels a bit shy of medium-bodied and a little thin on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. 
O: This beer has nice flavors of chocolate that seem natural and not too heavy and sweet. It tastes more like an English Porter compared to a Baltic Porter.Jul 21, 2013"
Meantime Chocolate Porter,4.0,4.25,3.25,3.25,"Appearance: 
Dark treacle brown. Slight translucence. Foamy rich light brown head with quite big bubbles.

Nose:
I thought fruity hoppiness at first and then pure rich, sweet chocolate with perhaps a hint of honey.

Taste:
Bitter at first with a deep rich chocloatey maltinees and quite a silky mouthfeel.

Finish:
Slight burnt taste with a final salty, tart bitterness leaving what I thought was quite a powdery feel in the mouth. Almost a bit musty!

Overall:
Loved the choccy in the aroma but wasn't a big fan of the chocolate left on the finish. Was also a little bit too burn toast end of the scale for my primitive tastes.Mar 19, 2013"
Meantime Chocolate Porter,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.25,"I like beers with in distinct bottles, and Meantime's bottles are simply cute: little flacons of delicately fluted yumminess.
What's inside is equally fine: a solid, dark-yet-not-black pour with a nice creamy bit of pale head. 
And that nose! Oodles of of chocolate-milky goodness, toasted caramel/chocolate malts and a hint of roast. Even if it were only for the nose, this is a beer to try.
Flavour and taste are perfectly congruent, focusing on a delicate yet firm illusion of chocolate, without the beer actually containing any. Slightly thin mouthfeel.
Elegant and tasty, spectacularly skillfully crafted. Ideal dessert brew; I'll pick this over pousse café any time.Mar 07, 2013"
Meantime Chocolate Porter,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.0,"Dark brown color with a nice thick caramel head with good retention and leaving laces.
Aroma of dark chocolate, initially less than I would expect given its addition on maturation, though significantly increased with the temperature. Hints of toasted, smoked and crude malts.
Flavor was more intense right at the beginning, starting with a refreshing and spicy sensation from its hops and carbonation, and followed by dark chocolates from toasted and smoked malts and then to a dry and slightly chocolate oily aftertaste.
Light to medium body with medium carbonation with small bubbles.
I should have just sipped while it was cold, this was so much nicer when got warmer. This is also an indication of its high drinkability, bitter, hoppy and flavorful and not really sweet.Feb 25, 2013"
Meantime Chocolate Porter,3.5,3.75,4.0,4.0,"Poured from a 33cl Bottle into a tasting glass.

A - mostly opaque brown with a slightly reddish hue on the edges. 1 finger head fades somewhat quickly and leaves behind moderate lacing

S - Strong scent of roasted malt with smoke and dark chocolate. The combination of the smoke and dark chocolate smells like baker's chocolate.

T - Dry smoke/malt in the beginning followed by mild chocolate. Chocolate bitterness with just a hint of hop on the finish. Leaves behind a very coffee-like aftertaste that lingers for a good bit. Pretty well balanced but very smoky.

*edit* As the beer reaches room temperature, the chocolate really comes out. A notable improvement on already good taste.

M - Not to thick, mildly carbonated. Very smooth from start to finish.

O - Well balanced between the malts up front and the chocolate/coffee bitterness in the back. I would say it's a little too smoky, but that may just be because the smoke taste reminds me of the voodoo bacon maple ale. I'll definitely pick up another Meantime brew on my next trip to the bottle shop.Jan 27, 2013"

Meantime Chocolate Porter,3.0,4.5,4.0,3.0,"A: Dark nut-brown colour, lets little light through, creamy tanned head, little lacing, decent head retention;

S: Strong and sweet chocolate together with a strong malt aroma, hints of caramel, very nice smell;

T: Starts similar to the smell, strong chocolate, but less maltyness and caramel than expected. The finish doesn't last very long, some hop and roasted malt bitterness kick in after the finish, a roasty, slightly bitter aftertaste lingers for a long time;

M: Carbonation level fits the brew perfectly, creates a slightly creamy mouthfeel although the beer feels rather light bodied, lacks some body in my opinion!

O: Amazing smell, pronounced dark chocolate, very appealing. Taste is good, mouthfeel and body lack something in my opinion thoughSep 27, 2012"
Meantime Chocolate Porter,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,"A: Very, very dark amber, virtually black. Off-white head.

S: Smokey chocolate.

T: Wow! Actually tastes of chocolate. Less smokey and tangy than lots of other English porters. Very well balanced - the flavours work perfectly well together.

Meantime Chocolate Porter,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Picked this up at Bert's Bierhuis in Utrect, The Netherlands. Dark mahogany pour with a creamy one and a half finger tan head with decent retention and nice lacing. There's only one way to describe the nose...chocolate! This has to be one of the most intense chocolate beers I've smelled. More of a sweet milk chocolate than the typical dark chocolate in most beers of this style. And it only gets better as it warms, with just a hint of coffee emerging late. The taste is a complex chocolate lovers dream. Dark chocolate, cocoa and milk chocolate all are represented. The sweetness of the milk chocolate and the bitterness of the dark chocolate are perfectly balanced. The mouthfeel is slightly thick for a Porter, but smooth as silk. The drinkability is off the charts. Usually beers like this are sickly sweet and more for dessert, but I could drink this all night. Will definitely be tracking down more of this next time I'm in the UK. Hands down the best chocolate beer I've had!Feb 06, 2012"

Meantime Chocolate Porter,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.5,"Had on tap at TJ Finleys in Bay Shore, NY. Served in a Palm Tulip.

Before I begin this review, I will say I have a hard time believing this is a baltic porter. 

Look: dark brown body with a thin, foamy white head that has a good deal of retention but no lacing. 

Smell: chocolate really stands out here but there's nothing else. If you've ever had Southern Tier Choklat, that's more or less what this smells like in terms of chocolate strength, minus some of the roasted malt aromas present in Choklat.

Taste: follows the nose with a serious overdose of chocolate. It took awhile for me to find any other nuances in the flavor but there wasn't much else except a bit of a bitter hop finish. Luckily for Meantime, I happen to like intense chocolate flavor in beer so this is still quite good though perhaps not as nuanced as I'd like.

Feel: medium bodied, a bit creamy, moderately carbonated, tends towards sweet rather than bitter and no alcohol warmth.

Drink: could have several of these without an issue. Definitely a sessionable brew.

Overall, I liked this one so long as I don't review it against the style. Nothing about this says ""baltic porter"" to me, not in the strength or the typical baltic porter flavors, which are all completely absent. I would drink this one if chocolate infused beer is your thing because you will love it, otherwise I wouldn't bother. Cheers.Jan 22, 2011"

Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Weizen,4.0,4.25,3.75,4.5,"I’m really wondering how the flavor profile of a Rauchbier is gonna play with the flavor profile of a wheat base. I guess it’s somewhat like a smoked Dunkelweizen, but that seems like a broad assumption. I’m not exactly sure what this will be like, but I’m excited to try it. I’ve loved all their other Rauchbiers so I’m hoping for the best

Pours a cloudy dark brown 2 fingers of rocky light tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

Actually, this is a lot like a smoky Dunkel, with fruity esters peaking through the smoke. I’m picking up on aromas of beechwood smoke, chocolate malt, overripe banana, clove, earthy wheat, and pumpernickel

It’s unfortunately a bit more subdued in taste, but what is here is still nice. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting tingly smoke, doughy malt, pumpernickel, golden raisin, white pepper, and herbal hops. The swallow brings notes of beechwood smoke, earthy hops, overripe banana, pumpernickel, white pepper, and caramel malt

A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a crisp and smooth beer. Finishes wonderfully dry with a light balancing sweetness

As far as these go this one was quite unique. It’s a really solid blend of flavors that I didn’t expect to work as well as it doesSep 21, 2021"

S- subtle but complex smoke on the nose with aromas of smoked pork, campfire and baind-aide. Undertones of caramel, toasted wheat, clove and cracked pepper

T- smoked malt up front gives flavors of campfire smoke, pork and char. Mid-palate starts to bring out some of the weizen notes, giving toasted wheat, clove, banana and some black pepper. The finish gives more subtle smoke that sticks around in the linger

Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Weizen,3.75,4.0,4.25,4.25,"This one pours a cloudy golden brown color, with a fluffy head, and lots of lacing.

This one smells like banana, wheat, medium-level of smoke, sweet malt, and herbs.

This one manages a nice balance between a traditional hefeweizen and a rauchbier. The smoke is definitely there, but like most Schlenkerla beers, the smoke is at a decent balance, and not overwhelming. There's a lot of banana, and some grassiness and clove character, with some smoky spice on the back end.

This is creamy, and drinkable, but it's definitely a slow sipper due to the intensity of flavor here.

All of the beers from this brewery are just completely uncompromising, but so well done.Jun 14, 2020"

The color is not necessarily pretty; a dirty barely reddish brown. The head is a thing of beauty in every respect. It's two or even three fingers on the pour, tight creamy texture, light tan color, and a full finger of retention. 

The aroma is a combination of Weizen and sweet and meaty smoke. Clove and banana in the background and a whiff of sweet bread. 

Delicately sweet and savory, like a smoked sausage with herbs. The Weizen character is still there, with banana being more prominent. It really is very meaty, though all the flavors are less sharp than the aroma. 

Medium body, very smooth, low carbonation. 

It's certainly a unique blend of flavors. The elements of the Hefeweizen are very clear and it's very smokey for a union that works, though I have the feeling it's a bit of a tight rope act where if anything changed it could end disastrously.Apr 15, 2020"

It's a tiny bit sweet. Maybe honey like, often used in BBQ sauces. I can imagine this paired with smoked meats. It's a thin mouthfeel and it coats the tongue with smokey goodness. Overall another fine Rauchbier from Aecht. Poured into an Imperial pint nonic glass from an undated 16.9 ounce bottle.Jan 26, 2020"
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Weizen,4.25,4.0,3.75,4.0,"More notes I found:
Look: Brown, some red highlights, head that falls too quickly.
Smell: Smoke. Malt, but dominated by smoke. 
Taste: Bacon, Pork chop, some sweetness, definitely the weakest of the ones I tried. 
Feel: Thinner than the others...Way thinner than you'd expect given the smell and look.
Overall: Not the best of the three I tried. I'd take the others over this one anytime. Still not bad and a unique expression of a weizen. Never had a wheat beer taste like this!Jan 12, 2020"
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Weizen,4.5,4.0,4.25,4.0,"Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Weizen is a German Rauchbier with a lot of smoke in the flavor. Yet it is very easy drinking.

Look: reddish brown with a very thick off-white head

Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Weizen,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"L: color between dark brown and brick red, very hazy with a thick tan/white head that sticks to the glass and dissolves to a thick layer feed by continuous tiny bubbles
S: Mild smoke with a sweet malty/meaty background like a neighbor slow cooking ribs over charcoal
T: Schlenkerla's trademark smoke is there, but only the barley half of the grains are smoked so it is much less pronounced than the märzen. Toasted whole grain bread, unfiltered yeast, caramel, muted citrus,
F: thick & meaty. Rich on the tongue with tingling moderate carbonation. Bitter-sweet up front with a pleasant bacony aftertaste
O: an excellent beer. Combining smoked barley with unsmoked wheat gives it a body lacking in most other weißen and the bottle fermentation melds the flavors. The lower levels of smoke make this very accessible for folks just starting rauchbiers.Aug 25, 2019"
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Weizen,4.25,4.5,4.0,4.25,"Pours a brown color with notes of dark amber. A large foam head displays great retention.
The aromas evoke smoked barbecue meats, bacon and smoked cheese. The wheat aroma is subtle and plays a supporting role.
The taste opens with smoky malts balanced with flavors of clean amber, biscuity malts. A sweetness begins to develop that reveals notes of caramel, chocolate and wheat malts. All throughout, the smoke plays a leading role, evoking muted notes of BBQ ribs and bacon. 
Medium bodied, smooth and with a soft chewy malt texture. The dry finish is effective for balance and drinkability. A gentle carbonation contributes to the softness of the mouthfeel.
I don’t quite get why the scores aren’t higher. Perhaps because it’s more smoked beer than wheat beer? Nevertheless, I think this is a wonderful smoky beer made by a wonderful brewery that specializes at this style.Jun 20, 2019"
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Weizen,4.0,4.0,3.75,4.0,"Nothing wrong here, would like to see it in a higher ABV with a more pronounced maltiness. The combo of smoke and wheat beg to be brewed big. Decent brew, needs some carbo for a wheat, maybe this one is old..Mar 31, 2019"
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Weizen,4.25,4.0,3.5,4.0,"Aroma is the typical smoked meat from this brewery, with charred oak, bready malt, and strangely, flowers. Taste is as advertised, smoked bacon, oak, malt, honey, and grains, but all fall to the smoke through the sip. Getting through the pint felt like an accomplishment in how robust the wood and smoke culmination added up on the palate. Feel is chewy and smooth, fuller bodied.Mar 12, 2019"

Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Weizen,4.0,4.0,4.25,4.0,"cl bottle, 1m past bb.

Dark amber, decent foam which fades rather quickly for a weizen.

Nose is mostly Schlenkerla's trademark smoke, albeit more subdued than for the rest of their offering. In this already aged bottle it covers any weizen aroma.

Taste finally brings the banana and cloves on the side of the pleasant smoke. Lively but for weizen, restrained, carbonation, makes it all very drinkable. Just a tad of bitterness at the end distracts slightly.

Overall, not as magical as the rest of Schlenkerla, but a very good mixture. Loving grodziskie myself, I would suggest they try smoking the wheat as well. This is a bit too cautious an effort wrt smoke.Jan 20, 2019"
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Weizen,3.75,3.25,3.5,3.5,"Pours a dark bronze amber and produces slightly more than a finger of moderately lasting, beige, finely bubbled head that leaves minimal lace. Aroma is medicinal and sour with a stale smokiness with only a hint of the smoked meat character found in this brewery's other Rauchbier offerings. The wheat is there but subdued. Close examination yields very faint dark fruit and spicy hops. Taste is similar throughout but more musty smoke and sourness than in the nose. A somewhat bitter finish disappears rapidly in a bland aftertaste. Watery, thin mouthfeel. After reading some of the other reviews and seeing how different they are from my own I fear that my bottle was old or had been mishandled. This is the only offering from this brewery that I have found disappointing. I'll get around to trying another bottle as soon as possible.Nov 09, 2018"
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Weizen,3.75,4.25,4.25,4.0,"I see ""weizen"" on the label and ended up treating it as one thus pouring this into a weizen glass.
The appearance was a fairly thick and dark orange/coppery brown color. A good two and a half finger's worth of white foamy head slid off appropriately and slyly. Some messy lace.
The aroma had some sweet meaty/bacon smokiness up front with some dark bread/doughiness and a light whiff of caramel and an earthy spice.
The flavor yielded to the sweet smoky bacon taste up front with a delicate earthy underneath. Mild aftertaste of bacon sweet smokiness and earthy spice.
The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a fair sessionability about it. Good carbonation and ABV. Mild bacon sweet finish.
Overall, definitely more rauchbier than weizen. In fact, I didn't see any ""weizen""-ness at all in this. I liked this for me but weizen fans, I'd be aware of this if I were you. I'd definitely have again for me.Nov 09, 2018"

Pleasant aroma of flowery and fruity hops, hints of cedar wood.

Hitachino Nest Japanese Classic Ale,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"I'm no English IPA expert, bu the citrusy brightness of this beer makes me think it is more like an ""American"" IPA - that aside, a fairly amber-colored beer, hazy but not opaque... ""matured in Cedar casks which are commonly used in the brewing of traditional Japanese sake"" - I don't know if that means matured in sake casks or casks *similar* to those used to age sake, but this is a solid beer - so far Kiuchi's Hitachino Nest beers are 3 for 3... Give it a try...May 01, 2020"
Hitachino Nest Japanese Classic Ale,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.75,"Let me tell you first off: this is a great beer! It has the trademarks of a great English IPA and it takes it even higher, to a level that perhaps no real English IPAs could reach!
Imagine it like this: you have a malty, bitter English-hopped IPA, but made smooth, almost sweet like caramel, toffee and vanilla but very faintly, just enough to make the flavor extremely pleasant. It is far from being truly sweet, still it feels sweet in a sense like something that makes you happy.
At the same time, it is still hoppy so it doesn’t get heavy or too malty like a porter or a stout. It IS a real (English) IPA, but made into a piece of art.
The only question: why is it called a Japanese Classic Ale? Most of the Japanese brewers can’t make such a thing, maybe only Kiuchi with Hitachino Nest...
But nevertheless, it is a classic. Glad I bought it (and it is a rare statement indeed when it comes to Japanese beers!)Nov 22, 2019"
Hitachino Nest Japanese Classic Ale,4.0,4.0,4.25,4.25,"L: pours a hazy orange/Amber with a very fine head.

A: candied orange, pine/cedar, Malts

T: Follows the nose closely. Candied orange and caramel maltiness that leads into a slightly piney bitterness. Really refreshing beer.

MF: somehow bubbly but also oily. Pleasant.

Aromas of big grapefruit, lemon, orange, peach, pear, apricot, mango, cedar, citrus peel/rind, pepper, pine, caramel, brown sugar, toasted biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness.

Lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon, orange, peach, pear, apricot, mango, cedar, citrus peel/rind, pepper, pine, caramel, brown sugar, toasted biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/earthy hops, cedar, bready malts, and fruity yeast flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready, fairly sticky, and lightly tannic mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol for 7%. Overall this is a delicious English IPA.

Hitachino Nest Japanese Classic Ale,3.75,3.5,4.0,4.0,"Served in a tulip glass from the bottle. 

Appearance: Medium carbonated body coming off a straight Amber color slightly cloudy. White head rising just about a notch or so below a finger's length. 

Smell: Malts and lemon scent, little light and not the most pleasing scent. 

Taste: Sweet apple and citrus skin flavor, that lemon I was smelling was definitely more amplified as the brew kept warming up. Builds up with a smooth smooth malt which actually feels like a thirst quencher. 

Mouth: light to medium carbonation. 

Overall: Good brew, smooth beginner drink for a long night. Salud!Apr 12, 2017"

Hitachino Nest Japanese Classic Ale,3.75,3.25,3.75,4.0,"Poured into a narrow glass, color is copper, head is light tan with mixture of bubble sizes, nice lacing down the side of the glass.

Smell is very subtle, presenting as clean pale malt, some biscuit/toast then some very very light earthy hops.

Taste is clean pale malt, some more biscuit and toast; hops are still very light but a more bitter presence is noted, flavors are clean/earthy.

Mouthfeel is very good, especially for an ale that is probably a bit older in the bottle than intended as i picked it up on discount. 

Overall, a very good english style pale ale, very clean aroma and flavors but nothing emphatic, very easy drinking.May 08, 2016"
Hitachino Nest Japanese Classic Ale,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Got a bottle of this as a present for my birthday! Not my favorite style of beer, and coming from across the sea, getting a good, fresh, well maintained sample can be a challenge. This tasted like a pretty good sample, if maybe maybe a tiny bit old as I've sampled an IPA or two in my time that has gone past its shelf life. Mild bitterness with some tea flavors. Some apricot flavors. Moderate texture in the finish. 
I enjoyed my bottle of beer. I would probably enjoy it more in Japan. For the style, I'd probably rather have a Brooklyn East IPA considering that I live in Jersey City at the moment.Apr 02, 2016"

Palate - again not expressive but some very nice flavours. Floral, tropical fruit, pineapple, grapefruit a little spice. Well Balanced. Low bitterness for an IPA, if that's what it really is, bottle says Japanese Classic Ale. Tastes more like a pale ale than an IPA. Again, convoluted Japanese marketing just confuses matters.

Mouth is good - quite full.

Hitachino Nest Japanese Classic Ale,3.75,3.75,3.75,4.0,"12oz on draft at Tavernakya in Madison, Wisconsin.

Body is medium copper, clear with an orange hue, one finger white head which lingers quite a while. Some lacing. Smells of sweet caramel, floral and earthy notes, a bit of tropical fruit (a bit surprising for an English style pale ale, indeed), no orange marmalade. Smells on the sweeter side, some tapioca. Flavour is balanced, though slightly biased in favour of the malts- caramel, tapioca- rounded out by some citrus, floral and earthy notes. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, substantial, not too sticky nor too dry, just sweet enough that it balances out any bitterness the hops impart. Definitely a more English-style in terms of the malt to hop balance, but the hops do contribute a nice bright and lively character to accompany the malt.Feb 07, 2016"

APPEARANCE: a flourishing, bubbly amber orange body that shows opaquely... head is nearly two fingers' worth of bubbly, creaminess; fingers outstretch from its waves... leaves artistic smears in its sky... AROMA: light, airy hops that evoke peach, mango and grapefruit--almost tropical... malts are woody, slightly musky, and pungent--an earthy, mellow IPA... PALATE: medium-bodied, easy-drinking, and textured--provides a pleasant but nuanced drink.. TASTE: soft honeysuckle and lilac make for a light, floral start; the lemon, mango and damp yeasts make for a varied experience... the malts are balanced, giving off a bit of earthy, wooden notes, old and familiar, with some vegetable notes.. OVERALL: having passed many of these bottles through the decades, this particular one found its way into a break pack sampler...a worthwhile throwback to the day when IPA meant long ship travel, not East Coast/West Coast hop nuances...subtle in its strength and reasonable in its memorable flavor, this is a beer worth seeking out again...Jan 01, 2016"

Hitachino Nest Japanese Classic Ale,3.75,3.5,4.0,4.0,"Chilled and poured from a 330ml bottle into a pint glass.

A: Deep golden colour with a slight reddish hue, very clear with visible tiny bubbles rising to the inch-thick white head that dissipates quickly.


S: First sniff was hit with a funky smell straight in the face, with subsequent sniffs revealing aroma of spicy hops, cedar, orange, some hints of brown rice.

T: A tinge of caramel sweetness and plenty doses of spicy bitter hops, with a blanket of cedar flavor which grows more prominent towards the end of each sip. The bitterness was slightly dominating in the beginning but balanced out by the malty flavor as the beer slightly warms. Some nutty flavors are also present when the beer is slightly warm. And maybe some roasted rice?

M: Medium-light bodied with an okay carbonation level, quite fine as any higher carbonation may clash with the flavor of the beer.

O: First sip turns out as an okay hoppy ale, but as it slowly warms it becomes more exciting with a complexity of subtle flavor emerging and creating an interesting balance with the hops. The cedar aroma rounds off any sharp character notes which results in a complex and rounded beer. Enjoying it after a long day of work and a good plate of freshly grilled squid.

Reference points that this beer touched on for me was as a kind of Fuller's London Pride that is moving towards being a quad.

Hitachino Nest Japanese Classic Ale,3.75,4.0,4.0,3.75,"0ml bottle poured into a tulip glass

Look: Deep, amber orange with a hint of sediment and a few floaties - about an inch of tightly packed off-white/lighter orange head with good retention and lacing, finally settling down to about half a fingers-width.

Smell: The bottle proclaims that this is matured in cedar casks and yep, you sure can smell cedar in there. As well as that, there's a positive car-crash of malty, yeasty smells, peppery spices and the usual pine resin/grass/grapefruit aromas associated with hops. Hops and cedar notwithstanding, the smell is quite 'sweet'.

Taste: In short, cedar and hops - pretty much everything else is driven into the background. There's also a hint of bitterness not unlike stewed green tea but cedar and hops dominate with the malts creeping in at the finish. The finish itself is dry, long and almost astringent.

Feel: Medium body but lacks the sort of punch that, say, an American (or even British) IPA would have. Something to accomodate the Japanese palate, perhaps? As mentioned above, the finish is long and bitter.

Overall: Another interesting brew from the Land of the Rising Sun - I'd probably describe this as a Japanese take on an IPA, since it's trying very hard to be like an American IPA but not quite getting there. It's not really a great deal like an English IPA ... it just ... is. Not Hitachino's best by any means (Espresso Stout holds that accolade) but well worth a try if you get the chance and want to try something genuinely different.May 03, 2015"

Light for the style, but still a lightly syrupy feel, and little carbonation.

Smells sweet, boozy and fruity. The fruit is probably the most interesting aspect of the beer, but pretty much as soon as it hits my nose I'm thinking. ""Uh-oh.""

Sweet to taste, lots of malt and what taste like corn. Beyond that, pretty much without character. Hardly even a hint of booze despite being 9%. Must be buried in the sugar.

And the coup de grace is that this not a single - it comes in a four pack. Not suitable for sharing (inflicting) on your friends unless they're simply looking for another notch in their beer belt. Give this one a wide pass.Nov 28, 2013"

Some bready malt aromas, maybe a slight fruity mineral touch, not much else.

Strong initial taste which bounces off a number of contrasting flavours, sweetness, roast, nutty, (maybe a bit earthy?). Definite fruity aspect, contrasted with a range of somewhat cloying flavour. Strength is apparent but not too imposing. Seems a bit sour by the end.

Aftertaste is bitter, but also slightly nutty. Quite dry.

Amarcord Tabachera,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,"Amber/copper colour, solid ring of off white head, no lacing. Smell is sweet and malty, baked bread, fairly fruity notes, caramel and toffee, light alcohol on the nose. Taste is sweet biscuity malt up front, apple and other fruity notes, caramel and toffee, solme light alcohol notes, nice yeasty finish. Creamy feel, smooth, light carbonation, full body. This was pretty decent, not a show stopper but a solid brew that is quite pleasant, available at TBS for two bucks and change and well worth it.Sep 27, 2011"
Amarcord Tabachera,4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,"A respectably long-lasting crop of visibly volatile ivory foam crowns a hazy, burnt orange beer - looks Belgian to me. Is this really a Doppelbock? It doesn't really smell like one; much more fruity and yeasty than most lagers, with notes of baked apples, pears, brandy, musty cellars, and dried figs. Ripe, doughy, and caramelly - nice, but nothing special, really. Certainly pleasant enough to drink, although this is one of those beers whose flavor doesn't justify its strength. Chalky mineral dryness frames a profile of honey, orange peel, light rum, and golden raisins with an odd wheat beer-like character in the background: banana, lemon, and clove. Pleasantly dry and easy to drink, but I can't help but want just a little bit more.Jul 10, 2011"
Amarcord Tabachera,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.0,"A - Clear gold with a moderate head with some heft.

S - Nose is malty-sweet, with some apple, caramel and some light fruit.

T - Boozy. Strong alcohol and a big hit of apple. Bitterness is strong but not overwhelming. Lots of maltiness and seems relatively well balanced. Not too sweet.

M - Medium bodied and sharply carbonated.

D - Better than I expected. Decent balance makes this drinkable, but it's still a big, heavy beer.Jun 27, 2011"
Amarcord Tabachera,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,"Poured from 500mL swing-top bottle into a pint glass.

Appearance: extremely hazy medium-brown hue with a thin layer of ivory head. Not bad, but it doesn't inspire me.

Smell: the aroma's got what I like: a thick maltiness with dark fruits, raisin, hints of cherry, and just a bit of an alcohol bite. Can't wait to dig in.

Taste: not quite as ""on"" as the aroma. Subtle malt character is reduced, and alcohol heat is increased quite a bit. There's still a little good malt flavor here, but all finesse is out the window. It's not horrible, but I'm not impressed.

Mouthfeel: medium body; relatively chewy. Carbonation and silkiness are low, though, so I can't say I love it. Still, it's not too bad.

Drinkability: this beer isn't horrible, but it's definitely my least-favorite dopplebock. The alcohol really builds on the palate here as kind of a burning. I'm glad I tried it, but unless I find myself stranded in San Marino, I'm not likely to have this one again.Aug 14, 2010"
Amarcord Tabachera,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,"Review from notes in November 09.

A - Poured dark coppery amber with a slight haze and a short lived 1"" white head. Much bubbling from the sides and bottom of the tulip. Large patches of lace. 3.5

S - Heavily malty, much caramel and sweetness. A hint of sweet corn... What?!?! Not much complexity here. Perhaps a touch of figs as it warms a bit. Er... yeah about that corn... 2.5

T - Extremely sweet with some cooked veggies. Lots of caramel and a mildly tangy fruitiness. Decently hidden alcoholic warmth but certainly present. That vegetable taste is weird. 3.0

M - Medium bodied and mild carbonation. Smooth with a warming and dry finish. 3.5

D - The sweetness gets cloying and the alcohol is rather prominent. 2.5Mar 20, 2010"
Amarcord Tabachera,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,"ABV 9,0
Not very liquid beer deep amber in colour, not absolutely translucent with golden 2-finger tight head.
There are caramel, tofee, grain & some fruit sensations in aroma. 
Dense sweet beer, honey, grain & almost no hop at all, well hidden alcohol, middle carbonation. Special mouthfeel like after anti-cough syrup.
Good, but not essential beer
Type is double brown ale, however.Jan 18, 2010"
Amarcord Tabachera,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,"A cascading golden head ultimately locks in at four fingers, leaving clinging foam as it slowly settles with a fine coating of lace lower in the glass. The beer itself is honey amber and is about as translucent as honey.

This doppelbock is dominated by the grain bill with some wet wheat in the background and highlighted by a surprise of nutmeg and cinnamon. However, the grains really are the main player.

While tilted to the sweet side, this is more balanced than expected from the aroma. Honey, rather than grains, takes the lead and there is no measurable bitterness, however, some hop flavors do come through. The finish is brief and almost instantaneous, leaving no other memorable impact.

This pilsner hosted a medium bodied, lightly carbonated lager with a silky texture. The alcohol, though weighty, is completely disguised.

While I have had few Italian beers to date, this one is by far the superior offering. La Tabachéra should work well with light foods and light occasions.Jan 07, 2010"
Amarcord Tabachera,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,"Hmmm, I think the best thing about this is the aroma. Poured witha fine small off white to light tan head that mostly faded. Color is a hazy and kind of funky amber brown. Aroma is malty, caramel, a little wine, nuts, a little hop, yeast, toffee. Flavor is similar but less going on. Body is ok and so is the carbonation. Finish is the flavor that just fades. An average malty beer that is just that - nothing special one way or the other.Dec 21, 2009"
Amarcord Tabachera,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,"My grabbed this new arrival to the shelves for me as a midweek treat. She's a keeper folks!

500 ml bottle flip top bottle. There was a slight spritz when the topper popped. Poured into a pilsener glass. Thin white head is pretty quick to recede. Color is a toasty reddish amber. Micro streamers fly up from the bottom of glass.

Smell is sweet and malty. There is lots of raw sugar, ginger, honey, and orange blossom. Taste has more brown sugar and ginger. I do not sense the alcohol at all, very well hidden, especially for a sweeter beer.

Mouthfeel is like a simple syrup. Not very thick, but still slick. Very mild carbonation keeps things moving. I don't think it's very much in the style, but as a beverage it is pretty good.

Amarcord Tabachera,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,"00mL fliptop poured into a snifter.

Pours a clear amber, fairly light for the style, with a small off-white head that lingers as a soapy swirl and leaves some boozy legs on the glass after each sip.

The aroma is pretty good, though fairly basic with the sweet caramel aromas coupled with some sweet fruits, mostly lighter fruits actually, with some apples maybe. There is a super faint toasty character in the nose as well.

The taste is also very sweet and one-dimensional - honestly tastes a little bit like watered down apple juice, especially in the finish. There are some caramel notes up front and toasted malts in the background, but the fruity sweetness is dominant.

The mouthfeel is very slick and fairly light bodied, almost watery at points.

I'm not exactly sure how to classify this beer and I guess doppelbock is as representative as anything. Either way, it's very one dimensional and sweet and overall a fairly average beer.Jul 12, 2009"
Amarcord Tabachera,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,"This is a strange one! I spotted this in a small café in a backstreet in Rome and asked for a bottle. Being in a half litre bottle, I did not suspect that it would have an ABV of 10%!!

Anyway, BB 09 09 (tasted on 31.05.2009) it poured a hazy red-brown body with a reasonable cream coloured head. Smelled of rust and malt. The taste was not for the faint hearted; an upfront red rusty malty beer. Alcohol not quite ""in your face"", but evident shortly. Peppery also.

There was not too much subtlety or complexity to this brew, and I probably shouldn't have liked it but, I did!Jun 30, 2009"
Amarcord Tabachera,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,"Grabbed a sample glass and poured this brew from it's 500ml swingtop. Looks a murky amber brown with a dead head of ivory that tries to pop up, but needs a pop of Viagra. Does make a better head attempt as she warms.

Bit of Barleywine aroma, with sweet malts, caramel and orange liquor swirling about. Not a dopplebock as listed here, but is it drinkable? It has a thin body that barely covers the alcohol. The hot finish kicks in with a bit of mediciney bite. Now it's kicking like a Samichlaus Bier dopplebock.
Strange brew, but ya know? I'd say to give one a try.Mar 19, 2009"
Amarcord Tabachera,4.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,"The aroma is papery and fruity with yeast, malt, corn, grass, and flowers. The appearance is amber with a large head. The flavor is like the aroma.

Amarcord Tabachera,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a half liter swing-top brown bottle into a flute glass.

Appearance: Clear reddish brown, with an off-white head. Little to no carbonation.

Smell: Nice malty and sweet aroma.

Taste: Very sweet with alcohol in the background. It's alot like caramel candy and the big alcohol content gives it a bit of twang.

BA lists this beer as a doppelbock, the back label on the bottle says brown ale, but in my opinion this beer fills the characteristics of a wee-heavy/Scotch ale the best.Feb 07, 2009"
Amarcord Tabachera,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,"Reddish brown pour with an off white/light tan head. Nice retention and lacing.
Sweet bready malt aromas and even some hops.
Taste is a bit of a letdown. Not anything like what a doppel should taste like. Malt character is attenuated but there is actually a bit of hoppy character and a bit of cough syrup character in the finish. It only gets worse as it warms up.
Mouthfeel is thin. 
10% abv limits the drinkability of this beer and it is evident as one drinks it.
Not sure what the brewer was trying to do with this beer. If it's a doppel it's too thin. If you want an Italian doppelbock Moretti La Rossa is a much better choice.Dec 31, 2008"

Amarcord Tabachera,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,"A: Cloudy orange brown with a big and rocky cream colored head. Head retention is excellent. Leaves a heavy lace.

S: Take one whiff, and you'll know that this going to be strong stuff. Alcohol isn't front and center, but it makes up a fair amount of the total aroma. Dark fruits, toffee and pepper make up the rest.

T: Strong without being over the top. Toffee flavors dominate out front. Bitterness has a well balanced pepper bite. There's a faint chocolate taste in the background. Finishes with a serious alcohol warmth going down.

M: Medium body is a touch doughy. Carbonation level is right on.

D: I picked this up on sale simply because I'm a sucker for flip-top bottles for my homebrew. Overall, I liked this beer. The high ABV crept up on me and would keep me from drinking more than one. A decent beer, but I must say that I'm glad I didn't pay full price.Dec 16, 2008"
Amarcord Tabachera,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,"Purposefully avoided/sat on this for a while after not liking the other two from the brewery.

Pours an oddly murky brown with basically no head. Malty grainy nose. Flavor is not too bad really. Woody sweet tone. Leafy aspect. Feel has a decent carbonation to it and the liquid is smooth. Overall not too bad to drink. Nothing to run to the store for (the price!), but decent enough.Sep 01, 2008"
Monteith's Doppelbock Winter Ale,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,"A bit confused between the Doppelbock and the winter ale - seems to be a duplicate entry. Either way, Monteith's website only lists one Doppelbock and the label is the same as the one I have so this is the 6% Doppelbock.

L - Great depth of mahogany color with a off white head that dissipated after a few minutes to leave good lacing
S - Malty with nice caramel and nutty roasted malt notes
T - Nice malts with hints of toasted nuts and caramel. Slightly more bitterness to finish than I expected, but not unpleasant (just a touch more than expected for style). Clean finish and a nice overall profile
M - soft full mouth feel. Carbonation is spot on

Overall a very nice beer - bloody good stuff and a good price compared to the other options I had in Australia ($18 a 6er, one of the cheaper things I had)Dec 27, 2014"
Monteith's Doppelbock Winter Ale,3.75,3.75,4.25,4.0,"Bottle: standard 330mL brown bottle with a simple but stylish label.

Appearance: poured into a tulip glass - transluscent dark brown with ruby highlights. A good, thick one-finger head hangs about for a good while with decent lacing.

Aroma: good aromas of sweet toffee and caramel malts, and some roasted coffee malts behind. A touch of spice also. Smells good.

Taste: a very smooth toffee and caramel with those roasted malts again. Just a good, solid and easy-drinking dark lager.

Aftertaste: the flavours linger for a time, which is nice. A touch of bitterness on the finish also.

Mouth feel: moderate in feel with a moderate carbonation that carries the flavour nicely. A very nice sessional beer.

Overall: this one was a big surprise for me - a real gem from Monteith's, who usually present average at best. The best part of this is the price, at only AU$55 for a case of 24 x 330mL. For a great dark beer that is a fantastic price - the only let down is the recent (to me at least) revelation that Monteith's have attempted to trademark the name 'doppelbock', even though it is a beer style, not their personally-devised name for their beer. To put that into perspective, they have already trademarked the 'name' (or rather, the international style) Radler and Saison, meaning no other NZ breweries can name their beer Radler or Saison, and no genuine internationals can import such a beer to NZ.Pretty poor stuff. Even though I live in Australia and not NZ, I'm not sure I'll buy Monteith's any more after finding out the above trademarking stuff, just on principle.Sep 18, 2014"
Monteith's Doppelbock Winter Ale,4.25,3.75,4.5,4.25,"During 3 years of living in Australia, this was without the best beer that I discovered. In Melbourne it seemed to only really be available in the Autumn and Winter, which was perhaps due to the beer's name. 

Not that many Australian's seemed to know about it, and it's stocks were generally quite low. I recall a number of times where I drank a few bottles and then had to choose something less exciting.

The colour is black with a mystic deepness, and it has a fresh, fruity, complex taste that is reminiscent of a dark Belgian abbey beer, yet originally different. There is a kind of dried apricotty taste infused with bitter mocha notes that forms a Christmassy overall experience that is smooth and easy to drink, yet highly complex.

This is completely superior to Monteiths other offerings, and is one of the best beers I have had.

Tastes of sweet, fruity malt with a dry finish. Notes of molasses, caramel, chocolate, dried fruit and yeast. A mild stewed hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth, tingly and a little slick. Somewhat astringent. Aftertaste of sweet, fruity malt.

Well actually the summer ale from Monteith's will no doubt be out soon and I will be sad, why? I'll tell you why; I love Doppels! They're big Bavarian bear-hugs of a style, and I remember when I was in Munich apart from drinking excessive amounts of Weiss's that Doppelbock was my go to brew. Prost bitch!

Poured from a 330ml bottle into a Stein glass.

A: Deep ruby red body with some foamy 1cm bone-meal coloured head action.

S: The malt aroma in this beer has it's own gravity! It's a bold malty biscuit fragrance with toasted sesame (weird but thats what I'm smelling) and a mild chocolate note. No hops on the nose, but this is to be expected from a classic malt driven Doppel.

T: Very on the nose with the flavour department; big malt biscuit base with toasted sesame and mild chocolate. The finish is long and dry with an accompanied tang of alcohol and minimal bitterness. Much smoother than expected but the taste of alcohol is a little more than it should be.

M: Quite smooth bodied and with a fairly low carbonation than expected this brew goes down easy... deceptively.

D: Intriguing in a way, but bland in another. I know it goes against the style but some decent floral hops would really have lift this brew into another dimension. However as it is it's a decent but average affair here. Would I recommend it? Yeah it's alright value as it is... a good kiwi go at what I believe to be a challenging style to brew. Sweet as bro.

A full bodied beer. A great mouthfeel, thickish and sticky, a warming alcohol kick is quite obvious in the chest despite the not extremely high ABV.

A great drinking beer especially in winter, I could sit down in front of a fire and knock a few of these down, now problem at all. I disagree with comments suggesting the alcohol should be better hidden. Its a winter ale and a doppelbock for crying out loud. A really top brew.Nov 11, 2010"
Monteith's Doppelbock Winter Ale,4.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,"009 Version--- 330 ML Poured into a SA glass

A-- Poured almost a dark brownish cherry color, nice color. Light brown head that was one finger in height. Took a few minutes for it to dissipate. Good lacing with the head. No visible carbonation. 

S-- Heavy roasted malts, some dark chocolate but not very strong. Faint bit of cherry and bread to this.

T-- A bit thin on the taste. Do get roasted malts, dark chocolate and a little sour cherry. Also thin and watery. Needs a bigger chocolate taste. 

M-- Starts off quite nice, then gets quite watery. Starts of with the chocolate and malts and a bit of like cherry acid. Then becomes very thin and watery on the backside of the mouth. Loses its flavor very quickly and finishes dry and clean. Medium carbonation and on the lighter side of body.

D-- One is enough. Not enough to this to want a second. Looks very good but after that is gets thin. Could be a really good beer. ABV is well hidden and drinkability is pretty good but the lack of substance is a bit disappointing.Jun 25, 2010"

S - Sweet bread with subtle dark fruit aromas. 

T - Slightly sweet at first with just a hint of bitter aftertaste. Dark cacao flavours with a massive roasted malt kicker.

M - Not bad, solid feel with decent fizz. Not overly noteworthy though...

D - Nice winter ale. Probably not strong or thick enough to be a true doppelbock but a good attempt anyway.

First taste the alcohol was fairly noticeable, even for 6.0%. Subsequent tastes not as much, but I'll chalk that up to desensitizing.

Strong maltiness & light frutiness (cherry?) characteristic of most doppelbocks.

Good mouthfeel, smooth with a good amount of carbonation.

Not too complex, but a decent flavor. Good for a New Zealand Doppelbock, left me wanting a German doppelbock.Jul 15, 2009"

Aromas of chocolate, dark fruits and spices are present. A touch of solvent like alcohol is also there.

Roasty with a hint of chocolate. Some fruity, spicy yeast character is also here. Just a hint of alcohol.

A nice heavy mouthfeel with mild carbonation makes this a rich warming beer. Good.

This isn't a challenging beer. It has some decent flavours but lacks the complexities of a good doppelbock. The alcohol could be better hidden. Not bad by any means.Jul 10, 2009"
Monteith's Doppelbock Winter Ale,3.5,3.5,4.0,2.5,"A full pint from draft before ordering a big steak. About half finished before the stone grilling is served. A limited release for Monteith's, during the NZ winter season, on draft and in six packs. The beer is a good 25% more expensive then the other in the Monteties sixer range. 
Appearance- A deep amber brown body with crimson highlights. Good head retention and a full tan head. A high amount of carbonation. 
Smell- A bit of chocolate and wheat. Nothing really comes through, seeing as the tap lines here at the Tap Room are as cold as frost on the windows.
Taste- A bit of chocolate, cinnamon, and a touch roasted malt. There is quite an interesting mix and surprising complexity from Montieth's. It unusually because you not expecting any degree of spices in the nose, but once the pint warms it was noticeably present.
Mouthfeel-High levels of carbonation, A medium body with the carbonation lightening it. 
Drinkability- Interesting I wouldn't say it fits the standard billing of Doppelbock. It went well with my steak. The carbonation levels got in the way of the beer and it was more of a high gravity dark beer than anything else.Jun 30, 2009"
Monteith's Doppelbock Winter Ale,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,"Dark brown with red, tawny edges. A nice big fluffy tan head that laced well. Not picking mc up on the nose. Some very soft chocolate notes and a touch of malt. Drinks pretty smooth. The chocolate comes to the fore and a little more bitterness than I expected. Finishes good.

Monteith's Doppelbock Winter Ale,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,"Pours a dark, dark brown with a red tinge, looks quite cola-esque with a fairly poor, weak head, quite pale in colour, certainly doesn't retain well. Doesn't produce much lacing except a line of sticky foam. Looks lacklustre but as I always say, looks like so many other bocks. 

Quite tart on the nose. Hints of dark cocoa, shiraz, almost a smokey character, but not strong. Fruity around the edge with a plum & raisin aspect. Quite nice but not very pungent. I expect a doppelbock nose to be strong and robust.

Taste is quite dark, with a fairly strong dark chocolate character with berries mixed in, but without the tartness. Palate is quite grainy, and there is a sticky sweetness to the mid-and-back palate reminiscent of soy sauce. Again, flavour is a bit subdued, but it is quite drinkable for all that, it's just a Woody Allen stuck in the George Foreman world of Doppelbocks. Mouthfeel is quite watery and dull although with traces of a sticky malt in there.Jun 19, 2009"
Monteith's Doppelbock Winter Ale,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,"Pours a deep reddish brown into an oversize 22oz wineglass. Foams up a creamy light brown coloured head which dissipates to an oily film. Some lacing. Minimal carbonation. Nice colour, good look.

Dark metallic notes on the nose, some sweet chocolate characters, but with an overtone of copper, rye bread and solvent. The sweetness does become more prominent as the beer warms, which is a much more pleasant experience.

Dark roasted notes dominate the flavour, but the palate is surprisingly thin and surprisingly short. There's a nice malty explosion on the front, but then it almost instantly declines to a thin residual char-bitter character, again with a coppery bite. The initial flavour is good - a rich, sweet, dark flavour, but the fact that it just drops its load then runs is a big disappointment. Mouthfeel quite thin.

Ultimately, this is a decent beer, but nothing particularly spectacular. I admit I was probably more disappointed because it has such hints of luscious flavour, upon which it doesn't ultimately follow up. Drinkable enough, but in my opinion, a beer labelled both Doppelbock and Winter Warmer should have a mile more character.Oct 05, 2008"

Being somewhat watery and tinny in aroma the flavour does surprise..Initially reminiscent of Tooheys Old with some burnt grain offerings it smooths out to an egg custard sort of sweetness. It finishes quite soft and smooth but does remind you of its 6%ABV.
Obviously not designed as a big session beer it is quite enjoyable and worth the effortAug 19, 2008"
Monteith's Doppelbock Winter Ale,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured out a dark brown, with some orange brown tints in the light. Little head with little lacing. Almost stout like in colour, but not as thick.

Lots of strong malt caramels, syrup and some chocolate. Almost similar burnt chocolate to a stout. Candyish.

Burnt chocolate, cocoa, with sweet caramel and syrup. Hints of hop citrus in the back palate, but barely there.

Light mouthfeel given it is a dopplebock. Nowhere near some of the great german ones around (Aventinus), but decent enough, and possibly the best beer from Monteiths. Quite drinkable, and scary if you didn't realise it was 6%Jul 16, 2008"
Coopers Best Extra Stout,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,"De color negro, con una fina espuma de poca retención. Cuerpo medio/alta y baja carbonatación. Aroma a malta y café. En boca destaca el café y una sensación de tostado.Thursday at 01:15 PM"
Coopers Best Extra Stout,4.25,4.25,4.75,4.5,"Coopers is an excellent brewery, making some of the best mass produced Australian beers on the market. Their Best Extra Stout is a constant quality item, and doesn't quite get the recognition it deserves in a market that's dominated with adjunct lagers. 

Look: Very dark, almost black in my Guinness pint glass. Thick frothy tan head, looking like an excellent stout. 

Smell: Lovely strong aroma of roasted dark malts, caramel sweetness, dark raisin/sultana fruit, slight bitterness from the hops giving it a almost cola tang. 

Taste: Lovely roasted bitterness from the malts and grains, and a nice bitter hop overall flavour. Hint of dark chocolate, sultanas. Definitely more bitter than sweet, definitely delicious, definitely smooth. 

Feel: Very rounded, smooth drinking stout. A little more bitter than sweet, good carbonation makes it very easy to drink. Slight hint of alcohol but masks it's 6.3% well. 

Overall: I'm not the biggest stout person, but i'm certainly getting more into them the older I get. This so far has got to be one of my favourite stouts that I've drunk, and honestly haven't had that many. 

Coopers Pale Ale was my introduction into the Pale Ale scene, and I still love that. Having grown and fondness and trust for Coopers Beers, I think this may just become a slightly more regular beer that i'll be drinking in the future. 

Godspeed, Coopers. For gods sake don't change the recipe!Aug 30, 2021"
Coopers Best Extra Stout,5.0,4.25,5.0,4.5,"My most favorite beer! Discovered in a roadside stop in the Outback while visiting from the USA. To me the taste is smooth, and I don't get a thick aftertaste and can enjoy the flavor. Sadly I can't find it in my backwards hometown.Jul 17, 2021"
Coopers Best Extra Stout,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,"An all natural brew full of bitter chocolate and fruit notes. Pours a tight brown head, all from bottle or can fermentation. More of a meal than a drink.

A South Australian icon and deservedly so.Jun 24, 2021"
Coopers Best Extra Stout,3.5,3.75,3.75,4.25,"Pours from the bottle near black with a fluffy ring of tan head; small streaky lacing. Nose is roasted malt, sweet, fruity cola, floral noble hops. Taste is far more expressive than the nose - bitter and dry roasted malts; unsweetened chocolate and cocoa powder; as it warms, some of the more floral hop notes come through, along with a slight chocolaty sweetness. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side, but has the big, crisp carbonation that comes with a Cooper's. Overall, well balanced, subtle, and surprisingly refreshing.Mar 19, 2021"
Coopers Best Extra Stout,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Coopers Best Extra Stout pours into my glass thick, and as black as pitch. The head is dense, the color of coffee and cream and has very decent retention.
My first sniff reveals a stout that is very malt forward, carrying an up front roasted quality coupled with an almost caramel sweetness. That caramel sweetness couples with something that reminds me of ripe dates. Beneath all of this is a faint, clean hint of alcohol giving the aroma a decent vinous quality. Things finish off with gentle, earthy hops before fading gracefully into the distance.
Taking my first sip reveals sweetness that tastes like a combination of both caramel and milk sweetness. This leads seamlessly into hints of roasted grain, giving me the impression of that morning cup of coffee with plenty of milk. Flavors of dates and general earthiness lend the flavor a nice backbone. Roasted grain builds slightly towards the finish, reinforcing the impression of that morning cup of coffee.
I like this stout so much because it has the full bodied, roasted, and somewhat sweet flavors this stout ought to have. However it's not so intense and heavy handed with those flavors as to overpower the palate. Too much malt and roasted grain can easily make a stout hard to drink. And yet, Coopers Best Extra is tasty, balanced, has some nice character to it AND is decently drinkable.Mar 10, 2021"
Coopers Best Extra Stout,3.75,3.75,4.0,4.25,"Poured from a single serve bottle into a stout glass

Pours an extremely dark but not quite opaque brown with a rather thin head and lacing, but overall a nice appearance.

The nose is heavy on the toasted grain with hints of chocolate and espresso. Rather sweet in aroma. 

The flavor is nicely balanced. Toasted grain, vanilla, chocolate, coffee and dark fruit notes for good measure. Just a hint of booze. 

The mouthfeel may be the best attribute of the beer. For a stout, it is well carbonated and relatively light. 

Overall, a nicely-done stout.Aug 04, 2018"
Coopers Best Extra Stout,4.0,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Decanted from a 12.7 oz (375 ml) bottle into a conical pint glass; best after 02/04/17.
A: Pours a very dark brown, almost black, color with a three quarter inch, mocha brown head, solid retention and lacing.
S: Nose a little tart and sweet up front, resolving to a mellow, mostly whiskey aroma, although some roastiness, e.g. coffee/mocha, in the interval.
T: Dark chocolate, vanilla, and black coffee flavors evident. Remains no more than semisweet, despite malt. Bitterness light but appropriate to the overall flavor profile.
M: Light to medium bodied with no more than medium effervescence. Not the sort of export stout that you feel you could park a truck on.
O: Does not impress immediately out of the bottle, but with warming, evolves into solid drinkability. Do not really see this as meeting the criteria for a foreign/export stout; really more like a schwartzbier, but enjoyable and drinkable enough.May 12, 2018"
Coopers Best Extra Stout,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.25,"Dark, black color with decent head. Thin, watery mouth feel (for a stout). Heavy coffee smell with woodsie, toasted malt taste. A little too bitter for my stout liking.Dec 24, 2017"
Coopers Best Extra Stout,3.75,3.0,3.5,3.5,"Black color. Head dissipates quickly. Not a lot of aroma. Taste is of malt at first, followed by a delayed note of coffee and molasses. Quite carbonated. Structure is a bit weak for a stout, but it could be that it’s old. Noticed some sediment in the glass.Mar 11, 2017"
Coopers Best Extra Stout,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,"appearance: completely black, 3 to 4 orangey finger head, great retention and good lacing.

smell: strong coffee, cocoa, and some woody aromas too. Nice.

taste: bitter coffee flavour with chocolate notes. Much bitter than I expected.

mouthfeel: although the flavours and aromas are strong, I found it a bit watery and with a strong bitter aftertaste.

overall: a really nice stout, maybe too bitter for my taste.Dec 26, 2016"
Coopers Best Extra Stout,3.75,3.5,4.25,3.75,"Best AFTER 1-2-15. Ok, guess I aged this one enough. Bottle fermented so I did a light pour into glass. Regret that since I didn't get a true picture of what the head could be. Body was black and opaque. 

Got a bitter bite on the initial taste, but was a little overly chilled. let it sit, which I should have from the beginning, and then the magic happened. Started to take on notes almost like an imperial. Great, boozy hints. Faint bitter coffee. Smooth. I'll take it.Nov 17, 2016"
Coopers Best Extra Stout,3.5,4.0,4.25,4.0,"L - pours black, with a thin light brown head. Looks like any other stout. 

S - Good strong smell. Vanilla and coffee.

T - Coffee, vanilla, and oaky nuttiness with some chocolate if you look for it. Sweet up front and slightly bitter on the finish. I think coffee stands out the most, with a good transition from sweet to bitter. Good strong flavors. More flavour than a guiness, and also a little more on the bitter side. 

F - About average for a stout, heavier than guiness, but also not as drinkable. I think it's just about right for a classic stout. 

O - Good classic stout. Everything is as it should be. I'll pick this up again for sure this winter. Good strong flavors, good flavor transition, in the middle as far as drinkability. Yeah I like this beer, I'll take this over a guiness or an O'sheas. Props to the guys down under.Sep 20, 2016"
Coopers Best Extra Stout,3.25,3.0,3.25,2.75,"80000 VND for a 375ml brown glass bottle in Hoi An, Vietnam.

A: Tan colour head of ~5+ minute retention. Light lacing as it recedes.

Opaque black body - classic stout.

Sm: Caramel, chocolate malt, malted milk balls, dark malt sweetness. No overt roast.

Aromatic intensity is average.

T: Follows the aroma, with overt imbalanced bitterness emerging post midpoint. Rough around the edges in terms of build; some roasted barley would be nice, as would deeper chocolate character.

Mf: Smooth, wet, a biteen powdery, well-carbonated, medium-bodied but a bit on the thin weak side for a stout.

O: Enjoyable and within conventions, but far from impressive. Drinkable and enjoyable, but unexceptional.

Coopers Best Extra Stout,3.5,4.25,4.0,4.0,"Poured from the bottle into a nonic pint glass. Best after July 13th 2014. okay then..

Deep dark walnut brown body and out of the bottle with a hint of red mahogany. A bit of floaties and suspended animation appearances. Head creation is a solid two finger with a nice dark espresso top and big bubbled puck and collar. Actually as not as bad it looks, it does look a little bit frozen. Floaties are of course optional.

Aroma is quite invigorating. Real nice dark plum and fruity ester notes, a real soft molasses smell that really cuts nicely. Gets into a bit of raspberry chocolate like angles as well, quite an excellent bouquet on this with lots of complexity.

Pretty neat brew on the palate. Light washing but with excellent body. Nearly char crackling grains, but a quick coffee bean bitterness hits the mid palate and then hits with a big fruited angle. Thick berries, fermented dark fruits take over, with a bit of mineral light body finishing as well. Nice lingering dark cocoa powder bitterness and ripping dark grains.

A different tasting FES that manages almost some real big Russian Imperial like character. Very nice indeed.May 21, 2016"
Coopers Best Extra Stout,2.0,4.75,3.75,2.75,"From Festival de las Naciones. In Teku glass. At dinner, with sausages + cheesr sandwich. Good stout.

Coopers Best Extra Stout,3.5,2.0,4.25,3.5,"Got this in a bottle at Emperor Barton's Boozeland in SF. Smell is a very mild malt. Taste is mainly burnt chocolate. With an acidic chocolate aftertaste. A fair amount of hoppy bitterness, not as smooth as I would have liked.

Overall pretty good, though a bit bitter to my taste.Mar 16, 2016"
Coopers Best Extra Stout,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,"From bottle at home. Just from the pour I can see this is a serious drink. It's opaque, No difference when held up to the light. Why did I hold it up to the light? Because & I could see by the unctuous viscosity this stuff means business. Business without pretense. 

The head was a nice rich tan colored tiny bubbles. No lacing at all. First impression is a distant smokiness that recedes until the aftertaste. All the flavors, & there are many, are nicely balanced...harmonious. Distinctively indistinct. A hint of licorice,,,or so it seemed. The usual grains seemed to present but in varying degrees of roasty/toastyness. 

The only thing ""down under"" about this is it's point of origin.

In a word: solid.Feb 28, 2016"
